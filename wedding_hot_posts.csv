I am ao incredibly hurt and feel like I shouldn't go to her wedding based on this. 

I asked her to be mine for my wedding and she said no, so I feel a little backstabbed and extremely hurt. We have been best friends since school, and the fact she has done this as seriously made me questioned going or not.

1olt96y,How am I supposed to come up with a realistic wedding budget if no vendors will disclose their prices?,106,0.98,51,bananascare,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olt96y/how_am_i_supposed_to_come_up_with_a_realistic/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olt96y/how_am_i_supposed_to_come_up_with_a_realistic/,2025-11-01 17:12:14,True,"I’m at a bit of an impasse because I don’t want to book any vendors until I have a very general sense of how much this wedding is going to cost. Once I have established my overall budget and know what’s realistic for me, I’ll be able to feel good about booking vendors within my price range. 

Here’s what I’ve done so far to try to get a feel for how much I should be budgeting for each vendor:

1. Pricing listed on vendor search engines like Zola and The Knot are wildly different from the few prices I’ve received from vendors. 

2. When I ask people who got married 2+ years ago, they think everything I’m telling them is absolutely insane because it costs more than it did when they got married. Unfortunately, I don’t control the wedding industrial complex so it’s not really my fault that weddings are expensive. 

3. I’ve already reached out to several different types of vendors (venues, photographers, caterers, rental companies). They will not give me a price range until I sit down with them and have lengthy meetings selecting exactly what I want. While I understand that every client’s needs are different, all I’m seeking right now is a very general range.

Does it really benefit vendors to not disclose anything about their general price range? Do they think that wasting potential clients’ (and their own) time by making people sit through meetings before they even know if they can afford that vendor is a good thing for their business?

1olrg3r,Do Not Hire James Alexander Films (Blue Sage / Goldtone Films) - Our Wedding Photographer Nightmare,29,0.95,6,sweeetlime_,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olrg3r/do_not_hire_james_alexander_films_blue_sage/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olrg3r/do_not_hire_james_alexander_films_blue_sage/,2025-11-01 16:00:00,True,"I don’t know how many people will read this, but I need to share our story to warn others about James and his many businesses (James Alexander Films, Blue Sage Films, and Goldtone Films) to try to get some accountability. I apologize in advance that this is really long, but I feel like sharing our entire experience with this man is important. 

My husband and I trusted James with one of the most important days of our lives, and what we experienced was manipulative, dishonest, and deeply unsettling. He lies easily, gaslights when confronted, and uses intimidation to deflect responsibility. Because of him, we still don’t have most of the photos and videos from our wedding more than a year later.

Our wedding was in the United States, but James is based in the UK and most of his clients are there. He advertises himself as splitting time between LA and London. This post is especially for anyone in the UK considering hiring him under any of his business names: James Alexander Films, Blue Sage Films, or Goldtone Films. 

His related Instagram accounts include:

I first contacted James in February 2024, about two weeks after we got engaged. I found him through an ad on Instagram and was immediately drawn to his artistic, documentary style and his use of Super 8 film, which I had dreamed of having for years. That was the deciding factor for me.

From the very beginning, communication was inconsistent and confusing, scattered between Instagram, email, and WhatsApp. He was constantly online but would take days to respond, often replying to only part of what I would ask or message about. Still, we wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and tried to be understanding, assuming that his delays and partial responses were due to his busy schedule.

We signed our contract on March 31, 2024 (James signed April 1st). On May 31st, he offered a “special” deal if we paid the remaining balance early: a small discount plus a free pre-wedding shoot. My husband and I hesitated but eventually agreed, paying in two parts on June 15th and July 3rd. I later learned he made this same “early payment for perks” offer to several other couples.

For months, we tried to schedule the pre-wedding shoot. Each time we reached out, he ignored messages and left us on read, said he was too busy, traveling, didn’t have internet access, was on set, or working other weddings. I expressed concern about the communication more than once, but he always had an excuse, acted confused about what I was referring to, or continued to gave partial answers that left most of my message unaddressed. When we realized it wouldn’t happen before the wedding, we agreed to postpone it until afterward.

An important note: we were getting married at the Santa Barbara courthouse. To get married there, you have to schedule an appointment and can only be booked three months in advance. Because of this, we worked closely with all of our vendors, but specifically James so they understood our desired date wouldn’t be set for a few months before the wedding. So we drafted our own contract to protect ourselves in case we couldn’t secure our desired October date. James agreed to all of our terms, which included clear protections around refunds, ownership, and sharing rights:

* “The clients will receive a full refund of the booking fee and any balance paid towards the booking if the date changes and the photographer cannot accommodate the new date.” 
* “The clients retain ownership and copyright of all photos and videos produced.” 
* “A photo release must be executed by the clients before any publication of photos or videos online or in print.” 

At the time, these provisions felt like necessary precautions to protect our wedding and our memories. Looking back now, they have become the strongest evidence of how completely James has disregarded the agreement.

Despite these red flags, we moved forward with him because we loved his work, believed he would deliver the images and videos we had paid for, and were drawn to the Super 8, which was probably the most important to us. We were trying to give him as much grace and patience as we could, hoping that the inconsistencies and delays weren’t an actual reflection of his reliability.

The day before our wedding, my husband and I actually joked that James might not show up at all. We genuinely wondered if we might have been scammed, given the way things had gone up to that point. When he did show up, we were beyond relieved and excited. He was the photographer we had chosen and someone whose style we genuinely loved. Despite the red flags leading up to the day, we wanted to move past the initial hiccups and focus on enjoying our wedding.

On the day, we had a great time with James. The only issue we had was that he gave almost no direction, even though he had promised he would, which was difficult for us because we both get nervous in front of a camera. Months later, my sister told me that James had been drinking leftover mimosas from the wedding party before heading to the courthouse, even though we had offered him his own mimosa that he had declined. I found this news incredibly bizarre and somehow entirely in line with the rest of his behavior that would follow.

Two days after the ceremony, he posted photos and video clips from our wedding on Instagram. While we were excited to see previews, our contract explicitly required written permission before anything could be shared publicly. We included this clause because we felt somewhat uneasy with James potentially promoting himself/his work with our pictures given the difficulties we had with him prior to our wedding. When we saw the images posted a few days after our wedding, we didn’t make an issue of it because we were still excited and assumed we’d be getting our full gallery soon. Weeks passed with no updates. When I finally reached out about the timeline for deliverables, specifically the RAW images. My messages were left on read.

In December, we finally received an online gallery, but found that key moments were missing: getting-ready shots, photos with family, and almost everything from our reception. Some photos were duplicated or showed people mid-blink or yawning. Out of the 700+ edited images promised in our contract, we received fewer than 500.

We were also supposed to receive:

* All RAW images from the day 
* Camcorder footage (edited and unedited) 
* Super 8 film (edited and unedited) 
* 35 mm film scans and prints 
* The pre-wedding shoot 

None of those were included.

When we asked James about the missing or less than great images, he claimed he “chose the best,” and the excuses began. At the beginning, each excuse seemed totally plausible and we in-turn respond with understanding, but as we continued to only be met with excuses, the pattern of manipulation became clear.

After receiving our gallery, I reached out inquiring about the remaining deliverables, specifically the Super 8, and James told me there was a queue because of the holidays and that we would get it in early 2025. At the time, that seemed completely reasonable and we would just be patient. I reached out again in February after not receiving any further updates, again asking specifically about the Super 8. His response was the same, there was still a queue.

In April 2025, after another round of chasing him down, he suddenly told us there had been a mix-up at the lab, but offered no details or explanation about what the supposed mix-up was, despite us worrying that our irreplaceable Super 8 might have been damaged or destroyed. Over this time, he also mentioned that he had underestimated the cost or processing time for the Super 8, but when I looked it up, I found that processing typically takes no longer than four weeks and costs at most $100. Even with a generous estimate accounting for a massive queue, processing should not have taken more than three months, and what we paid would’ve covered any increased or surprise costs.

July 2025, after 9 months of delays, unanswered messages, and repeated excuses, I had reached my breaking point. I demanded the remaining deliverables, hoping to finally get everything we were owed. Instead of simply providing them, James responded with yet another excuse. He claimed he had been hospitalized recently and said that was the reason for the continued delays. When I first heard this, it completely gave me pause. I believed him but a part of me started questioning whether it was true, which lead to guilt. Who would lie about a hospitalization? He had given so many excuses and reassurances before this that never lead to anything that it became impossible to know what was true and what wasn’t. But that is exactly the kind of manipulation James relies on. He twists situations, creates confusion, and makes you question yourself so that you stop pushing for accountability.

At the same time, I began connecting with other couples who had hired him. I quickly found over a dozen who described the same experience: poor communication, undelivered work, endless excuses, and being ghosted after full payment. Every story matched ours almost exactly. We created a group chat to share information, and the similarities were undeniable. Later, I learned that, whether or not the hospitalization was real, he only ever mentioned it to other couples after they chased him for deliverables. He never shared it proactively or as part of transparent communication. The queue, the lab mix-up, and the hospitalization were never about keeping clients informed; they were tools to deflect, postpone, and avoid responsibility.

When James realized that we were connecting the dots and that his reputation might be at risk, he blocked me on all but one of his Instagram profiles, to include the one that was our primary form of communication, but he finally sent a Google Drive link containing some of the RAW photos. When I opened it, I saw that the files had actually been uploaded on our wedding day. He had them all along and chose to withhold them for nearly a year. Even then, huge sections were missing, most noticeably pictures of family. This was a perfect example of how he manipulates clients. He provides just enough to appease you while still controlling and withholding what you are owed, keeping you off balance, confused, and unsure how to respond.

James has a consistent pattern of pretending not to remember previous conversations, rewriting timelines, giving contradictory explanations, and providing partial answers designed to create confusion rather than resolution. Around this same time, after I began warning others about him, James sent me a threatening message that included an article about a photographer who deleted a couple’s wedding photos because they didn’t feed him. He implied he might do the same to us, while falsely claiming we hadn’t provided him with food or breaks, which was completely untrue. We had made sure he was comfortable, fed, and taken care of throughout the entire day. The message was manipulative and clearly intended to intimidate.

As of now, October 2025, more than a year after our wedding, we have finally received part of the camcorder footage: one edited video and a few unedited clips, but a large portion is still missing. 

We are still waiting for:

* Remaining RAW images 
* Super 8 film (edited and unedited) 
* 35 mm scans and prints 
* Remaining unedited camcorder footage 
* $750 refund for the unfulfilled pre-wedding shoot and the missing edited images 

James has violated our signed contract, our trust, and expectations of basic professional conduct. Despite repeated follow-ups and assurances, he continues to withhold what we paid for, leaving us without the full memories of our wedding day.

It’s taken me a full year to work up the nerve to speak about this publicly. I stayed silent for so long because I was embarrassed that I ignored so many red flags, believing that James would eventually do the right thing. I see now that was never going to happen. Staying quiet only protected him, and he’s the last person who deserves that kind of grace.

At this point, this is about accountability and making sure others don’t go through the same experience. I’ve looked into small claims and bank disputes, but because he’s based in the UK and we’re in California, it’s complicated, and none of it stops him from continuing to do this to others. It also doesn’t get us what we’re still owed.

Despite everything, we’re still hoping James will deliver what we paid for and what our contract guarantees. I’m sharing this because I know how convincing his marketing is and how heartbreaking it is to be left without your wedding memories. If you’re considering hiring him under any of his business names, please reconsider. And if this has happened to you too, know that you’re not alone. Many of us are still fighting to get what we were promised.

Thank you to everyone who’s made it this far into this post and to the other poster who already spoke on their experience with James in this sub. Seeing yet another person speak up helped me realize that more of us need to speak out publicly as well. If you’ve also worked with him and had a similar experience, please reach out. The more we share, the harder it will be for him to continue doing this.

If you can, please help boost this post by sharing or commenting so it reaches others before they go through what we did.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E08B90>,self.weddingplanning,

BUDGET BREAKDOWN

* Venue: $1500 for use of space, it was an all-inclusive
   * Catering: $29,500 for 140 guests, no kids. Included pre-ceremony drinks, open bar, lots of passed and table appetizers, plated meal with 3 courses, and late night snacks.
   * Planner/decorator: included in venue. We didn't hire anyone as a day-of or month-of coordinator, because the venue took care of anything that happened while at the venue, so we were in charge of the getting-ready portion of the day. Venue staff even helped with our first look (off-property)
   * Bartenders, servers: included in venue.
   * Cake: included with venue.
   * Linens, chairs, tables, tableware: included with venue.
* Photographer: $3,100 for 8 hours, second shooter, and an engagement shoot. We love the professional pictures!
* Videography: $900 for just ceremony, special dances, and speeches. Last minute decision and surprisingly hard to find a videographer who provides this service!
* Florals: $2,500 for centerpieces for 14 tables, my bridal bouquet, 8 bridesmaids bouquets, 6 female corsages, and 8 male corsages.
* DJ: $2,000 for 6 hours
* Hair and Makeup: $1,600 for my bridal hair and makeup, 8 bridesmaids hair (I paid as a gift), and 5 bridesmaids makeup (they chose whether or not to do this)
* Wedding Dress: $2,000,  this was the upper end of my dress budget but absolutely worth it as it was the dress that made me feel the most beautiful and also felt like I didn't need to lose any weight to look amazing, which as someone who has struggled with my weight for years was priceless
   * Alterations: $400
* Groom's Tux: $200 for a rental
* Favors: $250 for little jars of honey, everyone took them
* Decor: $250, including seating chart, welcome sign, pictures- venue was beautiful without any additional decor
* Stationery: $800 for physical save the dates and invitations
* Officiant: free as relative did it
* Rehearsal Dinner: \~$5000 for 35 people (paid for by in-laws, don't know exact number)
* Photo Booth: $700 for 3.5 hours, props, printed and digital pictures, big hit with guests
* Dance Lessons: $300 for 4 classes, definitely worth it as we have two left feet
* Rings: $2500 for both wedding bands, don't know what my engagement ring cost exactly

TOTAL: $53,500

In addition to the big day, we had a private Catholic ceremony the day before for personal reasons. Happy to answer any questions if someone is looking to do something similar, it was for very specific reasons to us as a couple but I know there were other questions out there about this option.

* Dress: $50
* Bouquet and boutonniere: $100
* Pre-Cana: $1000
* Church Fee: $300
* Post-Ceremony Luncheon: $1200 for 10 people

CHURCH TOTAL: $2,650

TOTAL: $56,150

My parents (bride's parents) contributed $34K, my in-laws paid for the rehearsal dinner and my now-husband and I paid the remaining $16K. We're both lucky to have decent jobs and had started saving even before we got engaged. This was in upstate New York, so YMMV on vendors costs.

WEDDING RECAP and TAKEAWAYS

* The all-inclusive was definitely the way to go for us, we live in a different state than where we got married (my hometown) and it cut down on our planning decisions and saved us money in the end, although it wasn't cheap, obviously.
* Even though it was an all-inclusive, I did have stressful moments because it was mostly our families who were stressful, not the wedding itself. I'm the first sibling in my family to get married so my parents didn't know a lot of what is normal in weddings now, so communication is key!
* Everyone I talked to said 8 bridesmaids was too many, but I'm so glad I had my nearest and dearest up there with me, and there really wasn't a way to make it smaller without having it be only my sister/sister-in-law, because of friend group dynamics. Have the bridal party you want! The additional costs were minimal, about $1500 for their hair as a gift from me and additional coordinating. It helps that my friends all got along and have all been in weddings/married so they know what to expect.
* TheKnot registry didn't work for our international guests, even though the delivery address (our address) was in the US. ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E08EF0>,self.weddingplanning,

My MIL is saying we shouldn't bother inviting them if we're not going to do this, but this seems extreme to me. In my culture it's very normal for guests to pay for their own travel, and guests on my side of the family will be paying for their own travel. Granted, the flights from Japan are much more expensive and if they can't afford to come I completely understand, but to not even let them make that decision by not inviting them seems even more rude to me. My fiancé is really gutted as he hasn't seen them in a long time and wanted them the be a part of our special day, so I guess I just wanted to hear others thoughts before we write it off completely!",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E092B0>,self.weddingplanning,

I know it sounds crazy, but let me explain.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years. He is active in the US military and is due to leave for his next duty station in early 2027. We have talked about getting married & a specific timeline, to the point where we pretty much have it all planned out already, to make sure I can accompany him. He has already purchased the diamond for my ring ( because I’m so incredibly type A that I wanted to be involved in the process). We have a jeweller picked out that is gonna do the setting & everything. Sounds good so far doesn’t it? Now here comes my dilemma:

I have no idea when he is going to propose. ZERO. I don’t think it’ll be this year because I know he hasn’t  contacted the jeweller yet. And the crafting timeline for her is 8-12 weeks, so even if he were to reach out tomorrow, the ring wouldn’t be done until around February.

I personally think he’s gonna propose when we’re going stateside to visit his family in late March, early April. Which now brings me to my predicament.

I want the perfect wedding dress. And as we all know you should find the dress around 8-10 months before the wedding. We are looking at an August / September wedding. Meaning - if I wait until after I’m officially engaged to go dress shopping, I will most likely not be able to order a dress & will have to get something off the rack. And I really don’t want to do that. I want to be able to make changes & just find the perfect dress without having to settle for something just because the timeline doesn’t work out.

I feel super weird about it though, almost like I’m being too much of a Bridezilla. I was already very involved in the engagement ring process, because I wanted the perfect ring & now I just feel like I’m doing too many things in an unconventional way, when I’ve always wanted that “traditional” bridal experience. It just sucks because we are quite literally on a time crunch because of the military.

What would you guys do? Am I being too involved / controlling?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E09C40>,self.weddingplanning,

Bluetooth speaker for getting ready.

It’s technically not a fully open bar, but we could upgrade to a full bar for $200 more (plus more for the alcohol, since we’d need more variety). We live in a HCOL city, which also feels relevant. 

We LOVE these vendors and their services are definitely more of a luxury service, but we’ll probably need additional hours (at $250 an hour) and the total is nearly what we’re paying for catering. I don’t have much to compare this quote to and don’t know if that feels crazy or not. It fits into the budget, but it does feel like a splurge…

We can hire bartenders through our caterer, but we’d be responsible for sourcing the alcohol, mixers, etc. and we’d have to rent the actual bar itself. The logistics of that scare me a bit.

I just wanted to share my process for steaming our tablecloths in case it helps any other DIY brides, because this was one of my most daunting tasks. 

My MIL ordered our tablecloths from Tablecloth Factory rather than renting them, because it was cheaper. 

We have 12 120in round tablecloths, and 4 96x132in (I think? Ones for 6ft tables). 

I had no idea how to handle these beasts, but I ended up clearing off our bed (queen size), laying the tablecloths across the bed and steaming them with an upright garment steamer.  Make sure to use distilled water!! I also used an extension cord so I could easily move around the bed. 

After they were steamed, I rolled them in a pool noodle! I rolled 2 tablecloths per noodle. I got the noodles for $1 each from Five Below. 

I have heard that other brides have used the pool noodle technique but couldn’t find a solution on where to steam them, as they are too big to hang anywhere in our house. 

I get married next week and will post an update on how it worked if anyone is interested. 

Good luck to all the future brides!

Well Anne has been a pretty bad friend to me for the past year. a year ago she got super competitive with me during our grad school finals and basically freaked me out right before this really huge test that I already was incredibly anxious about by bragging to me about how she went through the study material like 6 times, I at this point was juggling a huge life altering event and was nervous about being unprepared. When the scores came out, she called me and asked me to check and tell her what score I got, while I was UNKNOWINGLY on speakerphone. Well I failed and had to retake it which was mortifying for me to have to share out loud. Her boyfriend who I had no idea she had me on speaker with was listening and reached out to tell me he was sorry to hear I failed.

Then I got engaged. Well I had no idea she felt competitive about this too. I excitedly told her and then told her how I’d love her to be a MOH. She literally in the most flat and sarcastic voice was like “ sureI’d love to.” As soon as I asked her to be a MOH she then told me she would either make Friend A or Friend B her maid of honor for her wedding (neither of those friends were me). That was her LITERAL immediate response. She has since then criticized every plan I’ve had for the wedding. She stated what she would do for her wedding instead. Also on my birthday, she came to visit my town “as a gift” but she actually came to visit her boyfriends family and expected me to driver her to her boyfriends family’s house on my birthday at 4am because she wanted to pick up her cousin from the airport and wouldn’t rent a car even though she flaunts her money in every other chance she gets. And she bought me a lunch as a “gift” and put it on her business card which feels weird? 

 I haven’t sent out bridesmaid invitations yet… would it be bad if I just sent them out and asked her to be a bridesmaid?

1olql8l,Reception Entry Ideas for a Smaller Hall,0,0.5,2,arch_d3sai,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olql8l/reception_entry_ideas_for_a_smaller_hall/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1olql8l/reception_entry_ideas_for_a_smaller_hall/,2025-11-01 15:25:28,True,"Hey everyone!

We’re planning our wedding reception and would love some creative ideas for our couple entry setup and flow. The space we’re using is a smaller indoor hall that fits about 192 guests (a bit less with all round tables and we cant reduce the guest count), and I’ve attached our current layout plan for context (see image).

https://preview.redd.it/489oocv9ynyf1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccea716a9e57f9c9d25be00329e39dbb7bb16fa8

Before finalizing the entry concept, we’re considering a few possible layout tweaks:

1. **Mirror the layout** — flip the stage and dance floor to the opposite side so the stage isn’t next to the washroom. The only downside is that the main entry door would then be right behind the stage area — not sure if that would look awkward?
2. **Replace one column of round tables** on each side with **rectangular tables** to create more walking and entry space.
3. **Add a sweetheart sofa** in the middle of the V in front of the stage for us to sit during the reception.

Now, we’re stuck on **how and where to make our entry from**. Since it’s a compact hall, would we need to walk through the guests? We also have an **outside food entry door** (which will be used for cocktail hour) — could that possibly double as our entry point?

Would love your thoughts and ideas for couple entries that work well in this layout and do not look awkward.

Thank you so much in advance!",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BAC410>,self.weddingplanning,

1oldv12,"Childfree wedding—regret, or is this a total communication breakdown?",6,0.57,69,polarbeardogs,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1oldv12/childfree_weddingregret_or_is_this_a_total/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1oldv12/childfree_weddingregret_or_is_this_a_total/,2025-11-01 03:20:05,True,"Weddit, I have a long story that feels like a possible miscommunication turned into something on the edge of a bigger problem I'd like to prevent. Help!

My fiancé and I decided that we wanted to invite only adults to our wedding. We had a lot of reasons for it, but I absolutely understand it’s *not* a night off. I know we’re asking a lot of parents to have a formal, adult evening with us, and we expect some declines because of it. Save the dates went out in August and were addressed only to adults. Our wedding website says “adults only” in a few places.

One decline we didn’t expect—and it’s not even that yet, since we’re 7 months out and invitations won’t be mailed until March—is FH’s sister-in-law, who we’ll call Violet. His brother/her husband, Edmund, is one of our groomsmen. Their daughter, Daphne, will be 6 when our wedding occurs.

Last night, in a group chat I’m in with Violet and our other SIL, Charlotte, she texted that she might not be able to make it if Daphne can’t come. I replied that of course we want her to come, and if there’s something we can do to make that possible, please let us know a good time to talk over the phone instead of text. She didn’t respond.

My FH and I feel confused—and honestly a little hurt—that this was a one-sentence text out of the blue from his SIL instead of a conversation with his brother. It was also weird that she included Charlotte, who has nothing to do with any of this, and excluded my FH and her own husband.

Some additional backstory: 2 years ago, Charlotte married FH’s other brother/groomsman, George, at a childfree destination wedding. Violet and Edmund arranged for Daphne to stay with Violet’s sister for the weekend, and it seemed like everything was fine. Violet and Edmund also had a childfree wedding 8 years ago.

Today, I feel like I blundered by not asking Violet and Edmund if what they did for George and Charlotte’s wedding was still good, but I didn’t think I had to because they have attended other childfree family weddings, and our wedding isn't a destination. Our wedding is a 2-hour drive from where Violet and Edmund live, and while we will have a welcome dinner the day before, we told everyone it isn't required for them; it's a courtesy for extended family flying in. That's part of the confusion—surely there's some compromise in between coming for the weekend and Violet missing 100% of the wedding, like coming for the ceremony and dinner? The blunt text in a group chat on top of what Violet and Edmund are choosing to do feels, in my FH's words, scorched earth.

Violet has been in the family for fifteen years and we love her, so our first inclination is to do what we can to help her be there now that we know it's a problem, but since they haven’t asked for help, we’re not sure if it’s our place to offer it. Our second inclination is to just let Violet and Edmund make the decision that feels right for their family, but again...this just seems very random and drastic with 7 months between now and the wedding.

If making an exception for Daphne is the only way we can have Violet attend at least part of the day, we'll make it work by allowing wedding party kids only. The problem there is that FH doesn’t want making an exception for Daphne to hurt George, who chose to handle (expensive) childcare for their daughter, Victoria, on his own. Charlotte's parents are staying in an AirBnB with them to watch Victoria. 

On top of this, we're supposed to visit George and Charlotte to meet two-month-old Victoria this weekend. Literally a few seconds after texting the group about our wedding, Violet texted the group that has all six of us to say she, Edmund, and Daphne won't be coming this weekend. Same blunt tone, and Charlotte was so confused by *both* texts that she asked George if he thought something was going on with Edmund, then called me to ask if my FH knew if something was going on. Neither of them could think of anything. 

So, weddit, what would you do? 

And where tf is Edmund?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BAC7D0>,self.weddingplanning,

My fiancé and I are thinking about combining our last names (think his last name is Parker and mine is Maines, so our combined last name would be Paines). We proposed this to our parents and they were… shocked to say the least. 

They don’t mind in the end if we do it or not, but they were heavily implying we should just hyphenate our names or just not change our last names altogether. They think it’s really weird we want to go with Paines. Our argument is that we want to be a family with the same last name and this is a nice compromise so that we each bring a part of ourselves in to it. 

We know that when we announce this to the extended  family they’re going to have a lot of opinions about - but all of our friends are very supportive about the decision. 

Is it too weird? Cliche? Taboo? Any advice is appreciated! 

Edit: For context, both of our last names are very generic and don’t hold much meaning family-history wise. On top of that people in my family were adopted a few generations back and changed their last names to match their new families, so there’s a bit of last name wackiness anyways.

And I credit this to my kids table arrangement. Below are my unsolicited tips. Use what works, toss out the rest. 

🧸 We sat the kids at their own tables. The youngest was 5, the oldest 19 (she wanted the kids table over ""boring adults""). The 3.5 year old sat in a high chair with her parents. 

🧸 We served their meal in to-go containers. They had chicken fingers, mac and cheese, and watermelon. 

🧸 One of the kids tables was solely for activities. We had Legos, action figures, glow in the dark bracelets/masks/wands, and friendship bracelet kits. 

🧸 We also had a video game corner, that kept several of them occupied all night. 

🧸 We had dirty sodas, as a nod to my homestate. And a fun drink for the kids. And boy, did the kids love the sodas. A few had to be cut off. 🤣🤣

🧸 Lastly, we planned the event with them in mind. Especially making sure their parents had a good time by providing entertainment for the kids. 

🧸 We got to introduce some niblings to churros (our dessert, no cake).

🧸 Our main goal was to create a core memory for our nieces and nephews. And we nailed it!

I’m recently engaged and my fiancé and I have been taking time to thoughtfully decide who will be in our wedding party. In my culture, it’s common to have large bridal parties with around eight or nine people on each side, but we’ve decided to keep ours smaller and more meaningful.

Because of that, we won’t be including my (future) sister-in-law or my older brother in the wedding party.

Also, I guess you just have someone be in charge of all that cash until it’s time to tip? And how does that work? Do you actually go find all the servers sometime toward the end of the reception? ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BAE930>,self.weddingplanning,

My partner and I are early in the planning stage for a Thailand destination wedding and would love advice from people who’ve done it. We are from Canada! 

Key details
- 50 guests
- Budget: ~$25–30k CAD (excluding guest travel)
- Vibe: modern tropical, ocean + jungle, relaxed luxury (we love the InterContinental Koh Samui style — clean lines, greenery, not super rustic but it isn’t available due to renovations!)
- 3-day flow: welcome dinner, wedding day, farewell brunch
- Ceremony: Western style with Thai food & floral elements
- Guests mostly flying from Canada
- Flexible on where guests stay (don’t need one resort for all)

Shortlist
- Koh samui 
- Phuket
- Krabi

Questions
1. Koh Samui vs Phuket vs Krabi — what’s best for this vibe & size?
2. Do you have any venue recommendations that fit this vibe?
3. Best months to avoid rainy season AND peak pricing?
4. Is ~$25–30k CAD realistic for ~50 guests in Thailand?
5. Planner + photographer + makeup artist recs?
6. Any “wish I knew this sooner” tips?

I was fully on the fake flower train (doing DIY arrangements) but my mom is insisting it will be cheaper to go down to the valley near us where there are flower farms selling flowers at farm stands in the spring, then making the bouquets ourselves with those. I’m thinking 12-15 small/medium bouquets for table centerpieces, 6 large bouquets for decor around the reception hall, tiny vases with a couple flowers each at cocktail tables, a larger arrangement for the sweetheart table and two large arrangements gifted to the church for the altar. 

Plus mine and bridesmaids bouquets of course, but I was planning on those ones being real anyway so I’m not really trying to factor those into the comparison. 

(Also probably going to do real for the church as they are a gift the church can keep for as long as the flowers are still good).

My husband and I got married on 10/11/25. Best day ever. Everything was perfect, even with the few hiccups. Here’s the list.

LOVED:
-Talked to my photographer ahead of time, told him what I wanted shots of, and then let him do his thing. He did exactly what I asked, and our pictures turned out beautiful. It was so nice not to have to delegate photography on the day of.

-Venue had a decor rental package. Everything you could ever think of for an extra $500. We ended up using a whole bunch of their stuff and saved so much money doing it this way… and everything was so beautiful.

-DIY invitations. Used Canva to design the invite, the details list, the rsvp cards, and the menu. Wrapped each invitation package in vellum paper and tied with a bow, then used Cricut machine to address each envelope. Sealed with a wax seal and some dried baby’s breath, and adorned with the prettiest stamps. Even with all of the materials, doing the invitations myself saved me approximately $500… and they turned out STUNNING.

-DIY seating chart cards and table numbers. Printed them off at the print shop. Beautiful, exactly what I wanted, and so inexpensive.

-My husband and I got our own small cake, and got cupcakes for the guests. It was really special to have our own thing, and the dessert table was absolutely gorgeous with all those cupcakes surrounding the centered bride+groom cake. It also saved us so much money doing it this was. We also used a home baker so we got to support a small business!! Not to mention, the cake and cupcakes were probably the best I’ve ever had.

-Changed into a $50 Amazon dress after first dances and cake cutting. I debated this because I spent over $5000 on my dress and I hated to take it off after only wearing it for a few hours. But my dress was so heavy and I was so comfortable dancing in my little Amazon dress after being sucked in that gown corset all day. 

-Seating chart, and no head table. I wanted my wedding party to be able to sit with their dates. I didn’t want anybody sitting uncomfortably with people they didn’t know… because what fun is that? My husband and I had our own table, and everybody else sat at their own tables where I had placed them with their friends and family. Everybody was so happy with their seat and had the best time.

-Went around to each table during cocktail hour and said hello to each guest. Took me 45 mins and then I was able to enjoy the rest of the night without worried if I had said hello and thanked everybody yet. Great success!

-Picked almost every song, even for the dance party. This took so much time but I am a music snob and I wanted it perfect, which it was. Totally worth the time and effort.

-Went to the bar with our guests after the venue closed. This may seem crazy to some but we are party people and that extra time with our guests was so special to have.

-Hired a family friend’s daughter to chase my toddler around for the evening. Best money spent. My family and I were able to enjoy ourselves without worrying about her wandering off.

-DIY bouquet preservation. Cut up my flowers and dried them in silica gel for about a week. Took them out and arranged them and glued them down in a shadowbox. Saved me around $600, it’s beautiful, and I didn’t have to worry about sending in my bouquet. Also way shorter turnaround time.

WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY:

-CHECK WITH YOUR CATERER OVER AND OVER AGAIN BEFORE THE DAY OF!! Call your caterer twenty times if you have to. Our caterer screwed up big time. We were supposed to have a family style meal… this was planned from the beginning over a year in advance. The catering team showed up with 2 staff members for a wedding of almost 100 people, and the food was BUFFET. And they set the buffet table up really ugly too. We had one guy running salads, it took over an hour to get everyone’s salads served before the tables could be dismissed for the main course. The food sat for forever in the chafers, making it dry and gross. Food was completely different from what I had during our tasting. Poor planning on the owner’s end, but I should have quadruple checked with him to make sure he had everything together.

-BRIDAL PORTRAITS!! I didn’t do any bridal portraits!!! This is not my photographers fault, he did every single thing I asked. I just completely forgot to ask for a bridal portrait. I also forgot to ask him if we could do some pictures on film. Our pictures turned out beautiful and perfect but I wish I would have asked for this!! I just forgot.

-WEDDING VIDEO. Even if it was just on someone’s phone or a little camcorder. We opted out of this because it was just out of our budget… but I wish we would’ve done it. Our vows, all the speeches were beautiful and we don’t have any footage. If it’s important to you to have those memories, get the wedding video.

All in all, it was the best day ever and we are so happy with how everything turned out. Everybody had so much fun, it was just a dream come true. Cheers!",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BAF1A0>,self.weddingplanning,

Is this a good idea overall? I asked him what he thinks but he’s just a chill person with planning the wedding, he’s just like “if it will make you smile and happy, it will make me happy too”

I’m getting married next fall at a beautiful venue in the countryside of Minnesota, however it is in the middle of nowhere. 

We want to provide a transportation shuttle for our guests to and from the venue since it is quite a distance from major towns with halfway decent hotels. This was our bad that we didn’t do further research prior to booking, but on the venue’s website it said good hotels were 35 mins away (which is reasonable and we were like oh yeah that’s totally doable), but now that I’m plugging it into a map it’s around 45-50 minutes 🥲.

Do we think that people will be okay with riding on a bus for that long to and from the wedding? I’m trying to look at it as it’s complimentary ride that will get them back safe and so that they can drink and have a good time.

A majority of our guests are our age (25) and will likely not bat an eye at this, but I’m worried that the older guests will think this is CRAZY. But also, I’m thinking if you don’t want to ride the shuttle, you’re welcome to drive yourself and go wherever you need to go. 🤷🏽‍♀️

Side note: We attended a wedding this past year that had to shuttle people to different town 35 mins away as hotels in the city they got married in were compelled booked, and the buses were full each round….so it makes me think it would be fine? What’s 10 more minutes than that….

We got married a few days ago, and always knew we wanted to honeymoon in February (work PTO logistics, not missing holiday season, etc). Our initial plan was a week on the island of Zanzibar off the coast of Tanzania, partly because it's close enough to the equator that even in February, it's in the mid-80s, so we wouldn't need to worry about the weather.

Fast forward to now:  We ended receiving **WAY MORE** contributions to our ""Honeymoon fund"" on Zola than we ever imagined. Our available trip budget is now $10,000!

We both put in a good 30 hours of venue searching and after realizing how much everything is we settled on having our wedding on our personal/family property. This poses different challenges but I love having more control over the space, don’t have to be out by a certain time, can start decorating the day before, etc. 

It’s my fiancé’s family property so we’ve bounced ideas off of his grandma and mom while still trying to be the ones planning everything. Every time we mention something they say “that just seems so expensive, 30 years ago it wasn’t like that!” NO DUH! 🙃 Trying to figure out food has been the hardest, and his grandma keeps offering to cook because “it’ll be cheaper” I’m like m’am I appreciate you but you’re not looking for 100 people. I think I found something that works out to $15-20 per person, then we can do apps and sides. Yesterday his mom and grandma said “that just still seems so expensive” ….. yes, it costs $2000+ to feed 100 people…. 

My mom said the exact same thing, and I’m just like GUYS I’ve done endless research on caterers and unfortunately, things are expensive and this is the best deal that I’ve found for good food. 

My fiancé and I have talked endlessly about wanting a beach getaway honeymoon and our dream was Tahiti but it’s way out of our budget. I found a great deal through Costco for a week in Fiji for $2,300-3,500 per person including flight (depending on what package we choose) and he seemed to agree with it. So last night I said “okay do you still think Fiji is the way to go?” And  he said “yeah but that’s just a lot of money” and I kind of snapped at him and was like “well if you can find something better let me know or we can just not go on a honeymoon and save the money” 

He’s actually been so supportive and is my favorite person so maybe I’m being a bit irrational, but it just really annoyed me. We’ve spent 4 months deciding to have a wedding and that we want a honeymoon…. So it’s going to cost $15-20k minimum and that’s the reality.

But what about the opposite? Tell me about the guests who attended that you never expected to be able to make it and how they did?

For example, I've two guests, J+K, who I'd pegged for being an instant decline, for a number of understandable reasons: J+K live a 4-hour plane ride away, young parents with a 1 y/o daughter, live in a rural area with no family nearby and where childcare is scarce, and K is a doctor at the end of her medical residency in a very demanding speciality. In spite of all those reasons, they still came to our wedding! I told them how happy and humbled I was that they made it, and learned that contrary to my assumptions about the childcare factor, they said they're so used to the dreadful availability of childcare in their area that they've long ago become accustomed to just taking their daughter with them everywhere and booking childcare on-site ahead of time wherever they visit.

UPDATE: Another guest I was shocked and expected to change her RSVP last minute, my friend ""C"" told me ahead of the wedding that there was a chance she might not be able to make it if her flight was late. Our wedding is about half an hour from a major airport, and C had a previously scheduled international trip to Europe that she coincidentally had her return flight arriving early afternoon the same day as my wedding (and within only a couple hours of the start time for the ceremony, so it was gonna be a very tight window, even without a flight delay). I told her it was completely fine if she couldn't make it, but she assured me ""I will be there, I might be hopped up on energy drinks to fight off jet lag, but I will do my best!"". Not only did she make it, but she relayed to me that she threw on her cocktail dress on the plane, and put on her makeup while waiting in line at customs. I was FLOORED she did this all to attend a wedding, and hugging her so hard at the reception during our table greetings. ""Did you KNOW what C did to be here?!!!? She is a rock star"" (hugs again).

We went through a reputable DJ company in our area and were willing to pay enough to have a DJ with more than enough experience to create a memorable evening. By the end of the night and in the day's after, we can say that we had a memorable evening because of the DJ for all of the wrong reasons.

Ahead of the wedding day:

We had selected our DJ company, and specific DJ, months in advance of event. Leading up to the event we had multiple hour long meetings, both with the owner of the DJ company and the DJ himself. We came to these prepared with a pretty detailed list of our music tastes including must plays, other song reccs, and don't plays at the direction of the owner and DJ. We also worked on a schedule for the day including all of the significant songs, speakers, and events which included links to all music related items at the request of the DJ.   
  
At this point in the process, we were sure that we hit a home run with the DJ, and were sure that they were going to be a highlight of the event because of how well each of our discussions went.

The wedding day:

Unfortunately our excitement for the DJ was short lived after the ceremony and very early into the reception. From here on, I am just going to drop everything that went wrong into a bulleted list along with our level of concern related to each item next to each item to keep this short

* Did not coordinate with venue food vendors to accurately announce when food was ready. Announced cocktail appetizers were ready when they had not been brought out yet **(No biggie, appetizers came out, people were fed, and we had a good time).**
* First dance song was completely wrong. Unlike other experiences related to DJ's getting the first dance wrong that we have seen, this wasn't just a version issue. Our DJ played a song that my wife and I had never heard until the moment of our first dance. We double checked the itinerary that we had completed with the DJ to make sure that the right song was linked, and sure enough it was, the DJ just played the wrong song on the day of our wedding **(Very concerning, was a let down to not have the song we hand selected for this special moment played).**
* DJ was drinking throughout the entire event. We witnessed and heard from guests that the DJ was repeatedly visiting the open bar and drinking throughout the entire time that drinks were being served. While I gladly would have welcomed the DJ to have a couple of drinks throughout the night, it feels wrong that it was as frequent as it was in addition to the other shortcomings during the event. It also feels wrong that the DJ capitalized on the open bar when he was working the event **(Very concerning, especially since we had a hosted bar that was charged by consumption, and it feels like I paid a guy to show up and drink, while sloppily managing a spotify playlist).**
* DJ played multiple repeat songs, music that we did not recommend while not covering many of our recommend/must play songs **(Mildly concerning, I am not super fixated on the playing of music we didn't recommend, because we expected/welcomed it, but to have repeats while not getting through a good amount of our recommended songs let us down).**
* Awkward guest interactions. Multiple guests have said that the DJ was awkwardly interacting with them on the dance floor and that it was obvious that he had been drinking/observed him drinking **(Unknown level of concern, I was wanting a DJ that would be willing to do some crowd work, welcome/manage requests, but this just felt different.. no one has mentioned anything about lines being crossed (aside from him being intoxicated)).**

In the few days since, we have reached out to the owner of the DJ company, saved drafts of the communications/itinerary with song versions, and have been reaching out to guests and haven’t heard back.

Here’s the situation: our wedding date is in April 2026. My twin sister is due to have her first baby on March 3, and we recently found out she has lymphoma. She’ll be undergoing chemotherapy right up until the baby is born. If everything goes according to plan, she’ll be roughly 6–8 weeks post-chemo by my wedding date.
I’m debating whether to cancel or postpone the wedding. I live on the opposite side of the country from my sister and have already taken unexpected time off. I also just moved states and started a new job. However, if I move the wedding, I’ll basically have to start over with the planning process since the church and venue have no availability left for 2026. It’s very important to me that my sister is there, but I’m feeling really discouraged at the idea of scrapping the wedding I’ve been planning for months (even though we’d get most of our money back).
Pushing it into 2027 isn’t really an option for us either. This feels like one of those situations where you just can’t have it all, but I’m looking for advice from anyone who’s gone through something similar. The doctor keeps saying some people “sail through” chemo, but with the pregnancy, that feels unlikely to me.
I also don’t really feel in the wedding mood right now, and I’m not sure I’d even enjoy planning a wedding during this time. Maybe I’m still processing my sister’s diagnosis, but I feel absolutely crushed at the thought of her 1) not being there, and 2) not having the wedding I’ve been dreaming of.

I’ll cut to the chase, I’m ugly. And I photograph even uglier. This is just the facts of life lol.

This subreddit was so helpful through the process so I wanted to share what I learned/how things went. Here is my overview because I know there has been lots of talk of how to make these styles of wedding work! If you have any questions feel free to ask. 

We had 65 guests, \~8 vendors, 3 bartenders, lots of wait/kitchen staff, and the two of us at a restaurant. 

**Timeline**:

* 5-6:15pm guests attended cocktail hour where there were drinks, bites, a tarot card reader, and a live illustrator. During this time we were doing our couple photos. Family photos were earlier in the day
* 6:20-6:40pm Our ceremony was in the restaurant
* 6:40-6:50pm Immediately following our ceremony we did our cake cutting and a welcome speech with a cupcake toast
* 6:50-7pm We left to go sign our marriage papers. During this time the bar reopened and more bites were passed for guests 
* 7pm We returned for our grand entrance and went right into our first dance along with my mom’s speech 
* 7:15pm Went into the heavier dinner items - cheese wheel pasta station, small passed plates, and we had an oyster station where a chef was live shucking them
* 8pm The tarot card reader and illustrator wrapped up 
* 9pm The dance floor opened
* 9:30pm We had strolling donuts come in to live dip donuts on the dancefloor for dessert which was a hit!
* 10:30pm Late night pizza and espresso martinis were also a huge hit
* Ended at midnight with a packed dance floor! 

**Food & Drink**

* Food spread across 5pm-10:30pm included the following per person and was more than enough:
   * At least 5 hefty bites (sliders, coconut shrimp, falafel, fried halloumi, potato rosti)
   * 2 small plates (braised beef with some veggies and a roasted cauliflower)
   * Cacio e Pepe pasta station served out of a cheese wheel
   * Oyster station (10 dozen being live shucked)
   * Cupcakes and donuts 
   * Late night pizza and cookies 
* We offered 3 signature cocktails (smoked old fashioned, passion fruit mojito, and spicy mango margarita), a bunch of classic cocktails since they can basically make anything most restaurant bars would have, full bar rail, beer, wine and cider, along with a wide variety of alcoholic options (cucumber mint refresher, blueberry thyme fizz, non-alc beer and wine, soda/juice). Looking at the tab at the end of the night it basically worked out to about 6-7 drinks per guest which is what we assumed! 

**Seating and decor:**

* We had a mix of cocktail tables, booth seating, lounge/couch seating, and standard restaurant seating around the venue. The venue has the bar in the middle which nicely splits things for the dance floor area vs. a lounge area.
* The venue itself was a vibe so we just had a ton of candles everywhere a few pieces of decor and then florals were moved from the ceremony to other spots around the restaurant.

**Additional notes:**

* We couldn't have done this without our external coordination team. There were 3 of them and they were LIFESAVERS. They did all the set up as well. They were the reason everything went so smoothly and took so much stress off our plate. We were assigned a venue coordinator by the restaurant but to be honest she wasn't that helpful and left before we even got there.
* Having a DJ was the right call. We originally thought we'd just have a playlist going but so glad we went with him.
* We had a bathroom amenities basket that got heavily used and I'd say maybe 10 pairs of dance floor flipflops from our basket also got taken so I'm happy about that! I definitely over bought but if it helped keep 10 more people dancing longer it was worth it! The foam lights and sunglasses were also a HUGE hit.
* Our tarot card reader and live illustrators were so popular! Kind of wish I just kept them until 9pm because it didn't sound like everyone got to see them but none the less they were wonderful to have and fit our vibe.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35AA3B90>,self.weddingplanning,

i’m getting married in august of next year in the pnw and am currently looking at what kind of makeup i want to do. i recognize that these are all filtered/airbrushed but i really love the soft glam w/ a lot of blush look. 

i’m mostly wondering a: is this a realistic look to do? if not this could i do something similar? and b: what kind of products should i use? for reference im a combination girlie (dry forehead and chin w/ oily nose/cheeks that have huge pores, basically a reverse t-zone) and i have skin that’s on the fairer side with neutral undertones (my clinique shade is CN10, my everyday blush is tower28 cream blush in magic hour, and my everyday lip is the pillowtalk lip liner w/ nyx fat oil stick in no filter needed and tower28 gloss in sesame). 

it seems like a lot of wedding muas use the giorgio armani foundation or the estee lauder one (when i worked at a salon that did weddings they used estee lauder), i’m mainly hoping to find products that are gonna last all day and not completely melt off my face/separate. foundation/concealer/powder/setting spray are my main concern but i will happily take recs for anything and everything! advice is more than welcome too! thank you everyone in advance 🤗",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BBFC20>,reddit.com,

i definitely want a pointed closed-toe, not almond shaped, to complement the pointiness of both dresses. I also want the shoes to have some sort of flare to them, nothing plain/boring.

They ask what they can do and I don't really know what to say. 

I think I've lost the plot on my timeline and what I need to be getting done (and therefore what to ask for help with). If you wouldn't mind looking over my plan - I'd really appreciate it!

Basic wedding plan --
* April 10, 2026:
     * 10:00 Hair + Makeup
     * 12:30 Lunch
     * 1:30-2:30 ""First look"" / couples photos
     * 2:30-4:00 Temple ceremony - immediate family only (<20 people).
     * 4:30-6:30 Family pictures
     * 6:30 quick private vows before heading to dinner.
     * 7:00-9:00 Catered dinner at my parent's, or possibly a local restaurant.

* Next day:
     * 12:00 Lunch with my family from out of state
     * maybe an additional activity? Not sure what...
     * Then stay in a hotel for a few nights with my new husband.

* Then Honeymoon (considering Oregon or Washinton, where we will take the mountain/forest ""bridals"" I really want).


We don't have any control over the temple ceremony - it is standardized and can't be filmed or photographed. You don't pick music or decorate or anything like that.

After the ceremony, we're planning on ~2 hours of every possible family photo combo (I want ""heirloom"" photos, my family is small, but rarely all together and we've *never* had professional family photos. I haven't seen some relatives in person in 10+ years, but I love them).


Budget:
* Attire: <$1,200
* Rings: $187
* Marriage license: $149
* Wedding planning guide: $5
* Makeup (to avoid my OCD triggers): $150 (trial is $125)
* Hair: free (family friend)
* Nails: $70
* Tan: $140 (total splurge)
* Invites: free (digital/Canva)
* Flowers: <$250 (bouquet, boutonnierre, 2 little ""flower girl"" bouquets)
* Dinner: up to $400 (catering either from my favorite local Chinese restaurant, or Italian restaurant. Both offer ~$13-20 per person). 
* Maybe a cake at dinner?: ~$25-45
* Vow booklets: $50 (splurge - custom)
* Polaroid film: $50 (already have a camera)
* ""Guestbook"" (for the polaroids): $55
* Bubble guns: $20
* Family photos photog: ~$750
* Debating getting a videographer since it is such a rare opportunity to have my family together (and at least one family member is in very poor health): ~$500
* ""First look"" photos: free (mom) or maybe 1 more hour of photography? $250
* Hotel (staycation 4 nights?): $600
* Hotel add-ons: Couples massage ($280, total splurge), chocolate covered strawberries (homemade ~$12), room service budget (~$200). Not sure what other activities to do...
* Thank you cards + postage: $30
* Dress dry cleaning: ~$150 (is there anyway to DIY this? 😆) 
* Maybe some sparklers, an audiobook, and sparkling cider for toasts? (No one in my family drinks) ~$100

= ~$4,898-5,768
(Taxes + tips already factored in)


Lots of little splurges in there. Obviously doesn't include the honeymoon trip, but we haven't even begun to think about that really. I contacted a travel agent (I've never used one before) for help.

My mom is handling the DIY flowers. I'll have my fiancé make the strawberries. Closer to the day I will order the cake (walmart), write my vows, and put in the catering order.


Things I know I need to do:
* find a dress (I tried some on at a boutique all in the $1500-2000 range. I want to find something cheaper).
* (afterwards get dry cleaning quotes?)
* finish a small registry
* schedule makeup trial (already found the artist)
* schedule hair trial (family friend)
* design invites on Canva & send them out (everyone already knows the date, so this will be to give more info)
* sign contract with photog
* get quotes from the 2 restaurants I'm considering (prices are from their websites)
* order things: vow booklets, ""guestbook"", polaroid film, bubble guns. Maybe sparklers.
* book hotel (I've narrowed it down to 3-5 decent choices, I just need to look more closely). (then book massages).
* make a photo shot list & maybe a Pinterest board of inspo to talk over with the photog
* look up videographers / ""content creators"" and decide if I want to hire one.


Help me out...
* What am I forgetting/not thinking about?
* What post-wedding things should be on my list? (Like dry cleaning my dress and sending thank you's. .. fiancé & I will combine finances, add me to his health insurance plan, and I will move in with him. What else would make this go smoothly?)
* Do you spot any potential concerns or flaws in the general plan?
* Tips?
* And then what of this can I delegate? 😆 Because this all feels like stuff I need to do personally.

 **✨ Special Touches**

* **Personalised invites:** Our digital wedding invite included pictures of our two cats and the host of bunnies which we have fostered / adopted over the years\~ 
* **Reception greeting:** Our friend’s dog was situated at the reception, greeting guest dressed in a tux and top hat! Guest could also take polaroids as keepsakes or to put into the guest book along with a note to the couple.
* **Split seating:** Two lunch sessions, the first with close family & friends at 11:00 am, followed by colleagues and friends at 1:00 pm. Each session accommodated 20 – 25. 
* **Canapé-style delights:** 6 mains and 2 desserts. Attentive servers came around with the dishes and cleared accordingly. We received so much positive feedback about the food!\~\~
* **Guest gifts:** A flower bar that doubled as ceremony décor and later guest could select their own flowers for a bouquet. This was a hit with my girlfriends and aunts who loooved it!\~ Our wonderful florist was on standby to wrap the bouquets and we donated leftover flowers to the café and the staff.

Most places I called wanted $1,500+, so this saved us a ton. They handled delivery, setup, and cleaning, and everything went smoothly from start to finish.

If you’re looking for something affordable but still high quality, check them out at NicePortables.com￼. Best value we found in Nashville, Franklin, and Brentwood.

I have officially gotten married and wanted to include some photos of the DIYs  (and Etsy purchases) to help others who may be trying to find inspiration. We ended up paying just under $6,000 for the wedding, and I show the budget breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1o02zco/i_finally_got_married_and_it_cost_me_less_than_6k/).  Both of us are huge nerdy so we tried to add some subtle nerdy additions to the wedding to show that off.

NOTE= All of the decor I don't mention was things the venue owner already owned and we paid her an extra free to add the other decorations for us so all we had to do was personalize things with my DIY projects.

Music: We played Spotify playlists instead of paying for a DJ.  This is such a simple way to add in some nerdiness. We had music playing before the entrance, all orchestra versions of nerdy songs, and then I walked down the aisle to Concerning Hobbits. We then continued the orchestral music during the cocktail hour. [This ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CTQJ3x0HRlu1c52NtCigR?si=913158f00f144831)is the Music before the wedding, and [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7dT8x6iOUTMkvtFDsxCdn7?si=137121754eca4228) is the music we played during the cocktail hour. We then played more normal music, [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6SJnsHH9ZkDi0D929GBh6y?si=48af5d0a29dd4a22), for the reception time.

Signs=

\-I made all of the signs in a fake stained glass style using Gallery Glass Paint. I also handmade the design template for the big sign. I added Hobbit Doors to the bigger stained glass on an easel (it is what the butterflies are sitting on). I made a post about that sign which you can find at [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYweddings/comments/1mtv8cq/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_hobbit_stained/).

\-the small sign on the table with baskets has a sword and the ""It's dangerous to go alone! Take this"" quote from Zelda.

\-I also had another sign asking people to write us letters and the papers used were handmade from an Esty store and had a hobbit hole on them, found [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1605245312/shire-home-letterpress-stationary?ref=share_ios_native_control).

\-I made a photo collage with a foam board from Dollar Tree and fake moss from Hobby Lobby and hot glued some clips to hold photos I printed from Walgreens.

\-I purchased the sweetheart table sign on Etsy, [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1300967279/lord-of-the-rings-quote-engraved-wood?ref=share_ios_native_control). It is a Lord of the Rings inspired sign and I love it.

\- I also made a sign for near the road to show the direction of parking that I printed at Walgreens but didn't get a photo of. You can print outdoor double sided yard signs on stakes already.

Cakes= The 2 cakes were from Costco and turned out amazing. I have a post [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1nw85pm/6k_costco_wedding_cake_turned_out_amazing/)talking about them. I got the cute  cake topper from Etsy, [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1121312219/gamer-and-book-reader-wedding-cake?ref=share_ios_native_control). The groom is holding an Xbox video game controller and the bride is holding a book.

Aisle Decor= I made the garden stake pieces that lined the aisle. They were garden stakes from Dollar Tree, with fake garland wrapped around, then I got hanging jars and moss (also from Dollar Tree) and hung them from the stakes. I purchased battery operated candles to put inside each jar.

Those are really the only things I had a hand in creating and/or designing. I was so blessed to be able to pay the venue owner to do all of the florals and other decorations.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35BBDC40>,reddit.com,

Due to some recent unexpected events, we are thinking to move up our wedding and turn it into a micro wedding/elopement instead. Would just be parents and three close friends instead of larger group and just a dinner the night of after a ceremony that morning at the courthouse. We can get back our full deposit on things booked and didn’t spend too long on planning so far, so we’re feeling okay about these changes, albeit unexpected. 

I come seeking tips and advice for other elopement/micro wedding plans on short notice! 

Planned budget below:
- $4000 rings 
- $500 flying in an out of town parent
- $1000 dinner food/drinks at restaurant
- $30 flowers for day of
- $800 day of attire/shoes
($0 make up and hair done at home)

Anticipated schedule would be pre wedding photos, sharing vows privately, ceremony in the morning at the courthouse, post wedding photos, (unaccounted for block of time before celebration dinner), dinner and drinks and celebration. 

I am most interested in any suggestions folks have for using the day and meaningful things to do between ceremony and dinner.

Living in a city where the average wedding cost is $30-50k was intimidating. We definitely could have saved money on the rings and dress but those were most important for me to splurge on! I knew I didn’t want a traditional wedding. I’ve always loved the idea of a dinner and drinks for a wedding. So intimate and elegant. I planned everything myself as I am a control freak. Overall I loved it and would do it all over again!

1oj11qm,(€7k) Eco friendly 2-day wedding for 100 in Ireland 🌊,677,1.0,35,zanyhemline,Weddingsunder10k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oj11qm,/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1oj11qm/7k_eco_friendly_2day_wedding_for_100_in_ireland/,2025-10-29 10:38:13,False,"Long time lurker, first time posting with our wedding breakdown 😊 We did a budget, eco-friendly wedding in Ireland for 100 people with a final cost of €7k. We had a two-day wedding as we had a barbecue the following day to use up excess drinks & food! Nearly everything was thrifted, freecycled, or handmade. All the chairs you see were free from Facebook marketplace, all the flowers were hand cut and dried by me, my partner and friends from hedgerows, the vases were all empty bottles, even the drinking glasses for our self-service bar were empty jars we collected from the café my other half works at, as well as our own empties! Thrifting, freecycling and making saved us thousands. We had a week-long build project with our family and friends beforehand, which was really special. It meant everyone got to know eachother really well and have left with lifelong friends. There's a Rock & Roll Bride article with more photos here: https://www.rocknrollbride.com/2025/10/a-freecycled-eco-friendly-totally-diy-polytunnel-wedding-in-ireland/

Here's the budget breakdown: 

Venues: Polytunnel in our garden and our local pub. €2,300 incl putting a chip board floor in the tunnel 

Decor: For everything, including seperate bar tent, bar, lighting, drapes, table dressing etc, approx €1,000.   

Flowers: Free 

Wedding car: My granddad's 1960s Cadillac. Free! 

Wedding cake: €14 for the cake ribbon. My mum's a baker, and so baked it as a gift.  

Alcohol: Approx €300 total on prosecco for an arrival drink, some table wines and a few courtesy spirits. We asked guests to bring their own drinks of choice otherwise, and we still have so much leftover after a two-day party that we won't need any for an 11 person Irish Christmas! 

Food: €1,550 including two food trucks (locally caught fish & chips and Woodfired pizza), a homemade starters buffet, a dessert buffet and a full day 2 barbecue. In Ireland you can recycle empty cans and bottles for a deposit return off your groceries, so the wedding night drink paid for the second day food! We also used up excess food from day one, which meant we were left with almost zero food waste. It was a meat-free wedding which we were really proud of.  

Transport: €200 for a minibus to transport guests from the pub to our home. 

Marriage registration: €200 

Celebrant: €700 

Outfits & jewlry €535 for bride, €190 for groom 

Rings: €650 for both. The wedding ring was also my engagement ring so this saved a big cost!  

Entertainment: Free. Our friends DJ'ed and we did a ""first DJ set"" instead of a first dance! 

Invites: €35 incl stamps. My invites and envelopes went missing so they refunded me, but then they arrived late. They told me to just keep them and the refund so I only paid for sealing stickers and stamps! 

Other odds and ends you don't think of: Around €200 in cable ties, screws, tape, food & beers for the build crew!  and other build project elements!  

Final total: €6,974.50 

This final total will be a little less as we've already begun selling some of the stuff we bought, paid for or made, and expect once we're done we'll probably make about €1,000 back making it more like a 6k wedding by the time it's sold. Anything we got for free, we've started to distribute through freecycle groups and to different businesses & groups in the community, so everything can be re-used and loved 💕",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35ACA0F0>,reddit.com,

This, of course, leaves me having to make decisions and guesses on things that I'd definitely prefer getting his input on since it's his day too. He's been *having* to shrug it off and let me work on it almost on my own which sucks to hear how upset he is about this.

planning is all going pretty well, actually. lots of DIY and we’re only having 20 guests. short daytime ceremony with a catered lunch afterwards, no reception. 

the one thing we just can’t fit into our budget is photography. I was hoping there’d be something out there for $1k and a couple hours coverage. 

photographers all have $2k minimums, most do $3k. I’ve tried sending polite inquiries about a 2 hour package rather than 6+ hours, but nobody ever replies to them. 

I truly don’t blame them, I understand they have a valuable skill and probably think I’m a cheap ass that they don’t wanna work with. It’d be nice to at least hear a “no”, though. 

at this point I’m thinking about just going without and having some polaroid cameras. I worked out the cost, it’d be like $300 to have a good amount sitting around. 

I understand people will say that it’s not good to rely on guest photos, but I’d rather pay $300 to maybe end up with a couple of ok, grainy photos than $900 for someone who bought a pro camera yesterday and will capture me squinting with a double chin anyway. at least the instax would have some whimsy to them, and for whatever reason I’m not sure such a person even exists in my market.

But then I got a quote from an actual florist and literally laughed out loud at the price so I figured worst case scenario I'd be out $300 instead of $2,000+ lol

Context: we're doing a 45 person wedding for under $9k (trying to not drain our savings before buying a house). Flowers were originally budgeted at like $400 but when I called 3 local florists the CHEAPEST quote was $1,850 for a bridal bouquet, 3 bridesmaid bouquets, and 8 centerpieces. I literally felt sick lol

I waited for one of their sales (which tbh happen like every other day) and got 350 flowers + eucalyptus + baby's breath for around $285 with free shipping. When they showed up I won't lie... I was nervous. Some had little tears, couple weird shapes, few smaller than expected BUT out of 350 flowers I only had to toss maybe 20? And even the ""imperfect"" ones worked fine for centerpieces once I shaped them with a heat gun.

The dyeing part... ok so I def messed up the first like 15 flowers lol. Watched a bunch of youtube videos but still didn't get the water temp right at first (pro tip: cold water + less paint for pastels, hot water + more paint for vibrant colors). Also add glycerin or they get super stiff and weird! My sister came over for two weekends to help and honestly it turned into kind of a fun craft session? We went through probably 3 bottles of acrylic paint from Michaels (don't buy their dye btw, it's literally just marked up craft paint).

Final cost breakdown: $285 for flowers, $18 for extra glycerin and paint, $35 for floral wire and ribbon = $338 total. Florist wanted $1,850 for the same thing. So I saved $1,512... which yes, I had to spend probably 12 hours total dyeing and assembling but even at $25/hour that's still saving like $1,200? And honestly most of that time was just waiting for them to dry while watching Netflix lol

Wedding was 6 weeks ago and ngl they looked better than I expected. So many people asked if they were real - like even picked them up to check? The colors stayed perfect all night (no wilting obviously lol) and they still look exactly the same sitting in my living room now. Plus knowing I have them forever instead of dried dead flowers in a box somewhere is actually really nice.

Would I recommend? Honestly yes, but ONLY if you're ok with DIY and have the time (like at least a month before your wedding). The quality isn't perfect but for saving literally over $1k it's totally worth it if you're on a budget.

It was an amazing day, and I (the bride, age 23) planned every detail myself. I am so proud of it!

Summary: We had a 1-hour church ceremony with livestream and a live choir, immediately followed by a 3-hour reception with a brief cultural performance, a buffet, a live DJ, a wedding cake, and full decor. We also had 2 photographers and 1 videographer for 4 hours.

I am happy to do a budget breakdown if anyone is curious, but here are my tips on **what we SKIPPED / DID NOT DO** to keep our wedding under 10k total.

* **Wedding dress purchase:** I rented my very large ball gown dress (+petticoat) & veil for $450 instead.
* **Real flowers:** We hired a decorator who used artificial flowers in all of our decor for the reception hall (my bouquet was real flowers though).
* **Lavish reception hall:** We decorated our church hall, which was $500 to rent for the full day, and it was beautiful and very easy for guests to access. They did not need to commute anywhere after the ceremony.
* **Cocktail hour:** We went directly into the reception after the ceremony, since they were both at the same location.
* **Expensive rings:** My engagement ring already has a diamond on it, so I chose a plain gold ring for the wedding ceremony, and my husband chose a silver ring.
* **Guest favours:** self-explanatory.
* **Paper invites:** Everything was digital.
* **Engagement party/bachelor or bachelorette parties:** I chose to see my closest girl friends one-on-one before the big day, and my husband did a group camping trip with his best friends (came out to around $50 pp).
* **Designated dance floor & other fancy equipment:** Our DJ brought all his needed equipment + some lights, but the middle section of our reception hall floor was used as the dance floor.
* **Bridal Party:** I had a MOH & my husband had a best man, but they were free to wear any dress/suit they wanted (no colour theme for guests of the wedding, just formal attire). We did not have bridesmaids or best men.
* **Separate photo session:** We did not do a first look, etc. Our photographers and videographer captured our entire wedding. When guests were eating their lunch, hubby and I sneaked outside with the photographers to take our own wedding photos and portraits.
* **Dance lessons:** We learned our first dance through YouTube.
* **Travel makeup /hair artist:** I did my hair and makeup at a trusted salon that I have been going to for all major events since age 15.
* **Large wedding cake:** We bought a wedding cake enough for 12 servings (for the pics), and a much bigger cake from Costco for the guests. Both delicious and more than enough for everyone.
* **Car rental:** We arrived separately, and we did not do a send-off, since many guests stayed behind to spend time with us after the party was over. We were the last to leave the reception.
* **Alcohol**: Controversial topic, but we did not provide alcohol. We debated on providing beer and wine, which would not have been too much extra, but ultimately settled on just soft drinks, lemonade, tea, etc.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E75220>,self.Weddingsunder10k,

We are in a HCOL coastal city and when shopping around found that doing a buyout was a better deal and less hassle than renting a venue and having to arrange caterers, etc. etc. Our budget was initially $10K but it crept up a lot. We had about $3K contribution from parents. Breakdown at the end. ETA: We had 50 guests.

Pros:

* We chose a nearby place that we frequent, so the quality of the food and service was predictably great.
* This also allowed us to show friends and family one of our favorite spots, and it was magical/surreal to see them all there in one place.
* Did not have to worry about any service logistics, table wear, set up or clean up. This was HUGE perk for us.
* Just had minimal florals as decor as the space was already lovely.
* Was within walking distance of hotels, bars, other restaurants.
* They had a private event space next door so we could hold the ceremony in a separate but nearby space.

Cons:

* Space was a bit restrictive and the mingling area was more cramped than I anticipated.
* Also because of this, no dancing (but we did go to a nearby bar after for that).
* Sound system was not great so I couldn't hear any music.
* We did not ask anyone to give speeches, but if we'd wanted to, it would have been hard due to the long, narrow shape of the space.
* The restaurant's ""event planner"" with whom I'd been communicating was not actually there that night, and there were some details that didn't make it to the staff working. In the end I just let it all go bc it was all pretty minor and I didn't want to spend the night directing people. (I accept that I should have forseen this and hired a more official planner or day-of coordinator. We ended up asking an acquaintance to help last minute and she was wonderful but we only had her for a couple hours.)

-The Arches in Coatesville. Absolutely beautiful and also love the flexibility to bring in any caterer. I do feel like it would be hectic using the same space for a ceremony and reception. 

-Giannis Catering and Event Venue. Was thinking about having the ceremony somewhere else and coming here for the reception. But I’m pretty iffy on this one. I do really like that they have a permanent bar area here, as we plan on having beer and wine.

For those that have used flower moxie design services- do they just make your cart for you or can they do custom quantities of flowers?

They helped us with our DIY tasks, lent us equipment, and helped us with set-up and clean-up on the day of the event. They also helped keep us sane, particularly in the last 1-2 days before the wedding when we started spiraling from all of the decisions that had to be made and stuff that still needed to be done. 

The other thing that helped us tremendously was to establish a ""mission statement"" that summarized the most important thing that we wanted out of our wedding and to stick to it whenever we were presented with a new idea or purchase. For us, the most important thing was to be able to invite our family and closest friends, rather than limit our guest list to cut costs. We didn't care about a fancy venue or extensive decorations or a videographer. 

We knew that we definitely did not want the traditional wedding for our area (ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, dancing). We're both pretty introverted and wanted to avoid being the center of attention--it would be more manageable for us to socialize in small groups. Loud music has us running for the exit, not the dance floor. I don't drink at all, and she rarely does, and neither does much of our family. Also, we aren't religious, so there didn't seem to be a point in a ceremony if we could just do it ourselves. And going into debt for this event was a hard ""no"" from both of us. 

Ultimately, we opted to host a picnic instead. It ended up being the best decision we could have made. 

.

# Budget Breakdown: 

**Venue ....  $100** 

A park near us has pavilions for rent that seat about 80-100 people. Some of the pavilions have better amenities nearby than others, so as soon as we got engaged, we made the reservation for the pavilion we wanted (namely, the one with a nearby bathroom and good parking), and that set our date. 

Admittedly this was a huge risk for us as it left us without a real ""indoor"" option in the event of bad weather, but the cheapest indoor venue we had found was thousands of dollars. In the end, we really lucked out with the forecast. 

**Food/Beverages\* ....  $1800** 

After many bad experiences getting sick from ""gluten friendly"" wedding caterers as a guest, we decided that a safer bet would be to order from a restaurant that we had eaten at several times previously. They had an extensive gluten-free menu and demonstrated knowledge/ability to prevent cross-contamination. Lunch was buffet-style. 

We definitely over-ordered on food, but at least that's better than running out. Our local guests all went home with takeout boxes. We still have some in our freezer. 

My mom made our small GF wedding cake. We bought additional non-GF cupcakes at the grocery store since GF cake can be disappointing to those who aren't used to it. 

*\* Full Disclosure: Our food and beverages were graciously covered by my family as part of our wedding gift.* 

**Rings ....  $1,700** 

Bought from a local, independent jewelry designer. We probably could have gotten something cheaper from a chain jeweler or online. 

**Attire and Grooming (hers) ....  $600** 

Bride's dress came from JJ's House, and she added a fancy lace topper that she had bought on clearance. She did her own hair and makeup. 

**Attire and Grooming (his) ....  $580** 

My suit came from SuitShop, with alterations by a local tailor. It's polyester, it looked fine for pictures, I might never wear it again (and I'm totally fine with that). 

I usually cut my own hair, but I opted to go to a barber shop for once so that the back of my head could be cut by someone who can actually see it. 

**Photography ....  $400** 

This was another area where our flexibility and low demands saved us a ton of money. Neither of us wanted to be photographed for 6-8 hours (we hate being photographed in general), and we couldn't afford a traditional wedding photographer anyway. What we really wanted was a nice, posed picture of us with our families, like you would have gotten from a portrait photographer. 

We ended up working with a photographer who does family shoots in addition to weddings, and a half-hour of photography ended up being plenty for us. We still ended up with hundreds of photographs to choose from! 

**Flowers & Decorations ....  $250** 

Flowers came from Trader Joe's. We weren't picky about specific flowers or colors, so we just showed up and bought a bunch. These were arranged 2 days in advance so that they would have time to bloom. We just put them in mason jars. Nothing too fancy. 

The only other decoration was plain white fabric tablecloths. It was cheaper to buy than rent, but it took a lot of work to wash and iron them ahead of time. Still, I think they did a lot to make the pavilion look special. 

**Stationery ....  $150** 

Self-explanatory--save-the-dates, invitations, thank you cards. I had a bunch of stamps on hand. We addressed and sent everything ourselves. Still working on the thank you cards, but we'll get them out! 

**Miscellaneous ....  $320** 

Our state allows self-uniting marriages, which saved us from having an officiant. Instead, we signed the paperwork with our immediate family as witnesses. 

We also sent some small gifts to thank the family members who came early to help us set up and stayed late to help with clean-up. 

**Total ....  $5,900**

Minus food/beverage costs (this was covered as part of our wedding gift)

1oh34nz,(11k) UPDATE - My Wedding Debrief,504,1.0,28,avreadriver,Weddingsunder10k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh34nz,/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1oh34nz/11k_update_my_wedding_debrief/,2025-10-27 02:32:52,False,"Hello all! I’m returning to you all as a newlywed. WOOP WOOP!!! 

Here is everything that went down, start to finish.

I spent so many long hours planning this thing, and it literally couldn’t have been more perfect! If you need a little motivation in the final stages of planning, THIS IS YOUR SIGN! Everything you’re doing will amount to nothing less than the best day ever. I believe in you!

I had some assistance here and there planning wise, but overall, everything that went down came directly out of my brain. Now, making it happen, came down to my amazing friends and family. Nothing could’ve turned out the way it did without our loved ones and I’ve never felt more loved than that day! 

Here are some things we did that made the day go so smooth:

1. Details! Having a detailed schedule for my bridesmaids and helpers (family members) for the day-of was the KEY! Everyone knew exactly what to do at what time; what decorations to set up, where they go, what time every vendor was arriving and who to meet, I mean EVERYTHING. It may seem so tedious but it was so necessary. 
I also had an announcement schedule for the DJ, the “must play” song list, and the ceremony schedule detailing what songs to play and what his queues were.
I also had a detailed Google Sheets project that I shared with everyone who helped set up and all of my bridesmaids that included my schedule for the day, all of the vendor/contact information, a list of ALL of the decorations as well as reference photos and where they go, the ceremony & reception map, etc.

2. This is a luxury we had because the venue was literally my mom’s property. We scheduled all of the rentals (tents, tables, chairs, etc) to arrive 2 days before the big day. This allowed us to position everything where we wanted it without the stress of doing it the day of. 

3. Because the wedding happened on land and not inside of a venue, restrooms were a really big thing for us. We rented a restroom trailer for the weekend that was air-conditioned and had running water so that our guests felt like they weren’t using Porta potties, LOL. They were very nice and a very well spent $1200. 

4. We had a comment about the food on my last post. We decided to have a catered nacho bar, and we got a few comments stating that “nachos aren’t dinner”, and I wanted to add that nobody cared what we were eating and everyone loved what we ate anyways. It was delicious. HOWEVER, we had plenty of options that were not nacho related so that people had choices. That includes salad, sandwiches, and plenty of snacks. The wedding, start to finish, was a 5 hour event (ceremony & reception). 

5. I originally paid for a half bar, which is a two hour bar. I ended up paying the bartender for an extra hour and that was the cherry on top. We were paying for all of the alcohol anyways, and we wanted to make sure our guests had access to the bar from the moment they left the ceremony. 

6. 90% of the decorations we used were DIY. We spent 2 to 3 months creating all of the decorations that we’d be setting up the day of and that saved us loads of time. It also eased a lot of would-be stress and were really fun to do!!

7. I really made it a point on the day of to release all of my control and trust in all of my planning. I understand that I may have gotten lucky that nothing went wrong, but I did have a very strong support system and a lot of people that wanted to help make sure the day went smoothly. It’s important to make peace with yourself that everything may not go the way that you planned to a T, but remind yourself at the end of the day you’re marrying the love of your life and that’s all that matters.

We planned this wedding from the ground up. There wasn’t even power running to the places we were having the wedding at, but we made it happen and so can you. I’m happy to answer any questions that anybody may have or provide support to somebody that is stressed out and needs some ideas. I hope everyone’s wedding provides beautiful memories that you can cherish for years to come!",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36E77A40>,reddit.com,

1ohjcmf,($8.7K) Budget Breakdown!,33,0.95,14,pinklightning1,Weddingsunder10k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1ohjcmf/87k_budget_breakdown/,/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1ohjcmf/87k_budget_breakdown/,2025-10-27 16:37:50,True,"We got married! I'll start out by saying this was significantly more than what we wanted to spend (I wanted to aim for $5k, but the wedding industry is a racket), but thankfully we were able to pay everything off in full, and my husband was very savvy with opening a few credit cards that got us both major bonuses (this subtracted a little over $1.5k from the total wedding cost). In addition, I landed some referral bonuses for a program I use for my job, which also helped a lot.

We had a 30-guest ""micro wedding"" at a lovely venue in the woods, with a reception under a shelter to follow. The most painful expense was the venue itself (especially considering it was a half day rental), but it was so beautiful and the owner was very kind to us, so we don't regret it.

Expenses:

**Venue: $3K**

**Photography: $1,650** (full day coverage and one of my highest priorities)

**Attire: $1,379.10**

Wedding dress: $492.48 (From a dressmaker on Etsy who did a fabulous job. Truly my dream dress!)

Wedding dress alterations: $205

Veil: $30

Bride's shoes: $108.62 (custom white lace sneakers from Etsy. They came personalized with our initials, wedding date, and my new last name)

Tuxedo: $490

Dress shirt: $48

Bowtie & pocket square: $5 

**Rings: $641.59**

**Dinner** (with drinks, plates, & cutlery): **$540**

We had an alcohol-free wedding with a pasta buffet (pasta, chicken, roasted veggies, bread, salad), punch, sparkling juice, sweet tea, and water.

**Bridal Beauty: $410**

Nails: $120

Hair & Makeup: $290 (I had a hard time finding a reasonable price for hair & makeup, but found a local lady through a wedding FB group. This price included a makeup trial. She did a great job!)

**AirBNB: $350**

Rented a nice cottage in the woods ($150/night) for 2 nights. Used it as a getting ready space for myself, bridesmaids, and flower girl. Then my husband and I stayed there the night after our wedding and enjoyed the hot tub the next morning!)

**Decor & Sparklers: $245**

Almost all of my decor was purchased on FB marketplace along with several things we DIY'd, and I'm reselling it to get some of that money back.

**Bouquets & Boutonniere: $198.90** (A wood bouquet for myself, wood boutonniere for my husband, and 4 artificial/silky bouquets. Most of this cost was my bouquet - I think I would've been fine with a less expensive one in hindsight, but I like that I get to keep it forever)

**Officiant: $100**

**Polaroid Film: $100**

**Marriage License: $65**

**Gifts** (for my parents, grandma, bridesmaids, and flower girl): **$61.91** 

I saved on gifts by handcrafting several things.

**Invitations: $30** (I designed them myself on Canva & printed with a coupon)

**Grand total: $8,771.50**

Credit card bonuses: $1,525

Referral bonuses: $690

**Grand total minus bonuses: $6,556.50**

  
You'll notice we skipped quite a few things: No alcohol, no DJ (we used a Spotify playlist), no live musicians, no wedding planner/coordinator, no florals. I skipped these so I could prioritize things I really cared about, like photography. Every bride might be different in terms of wedding priorities, but I didn't regret a single thing that I skipped!

My one piece of advice would be not to feel pressured to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on things just because that's what everyone else seems to be doing, and don't fall into the trap of making your wedding something crazy you see on social media. Remember that saving for a home is more important than a party.

Happy wedding planning!

(Full explanation below if you are interested in why, I swear there's a good reason) 

Does anyone have any advice on how to inform people who may ask that they are not invited to the wedding?

Should I wait for people to ask for a wedding invite or make it immediately clear that just because you were invited to the engagement party does not mean you're invited to the wedding? 

--- 
Explanation: 

I am American and my fiance is German. I plan on getting married in Europe because I'll be moving back over there at the end of the year. 

I can't afford to buy plane tickets for all of my family to come over to Europe for the wedding. But most of my close family (mainly my siblings) plus a majority of my friends cannot afford plane tickets on their own. 

I'm planning a more involved engagement party in America that my American family will be able to attend. Unfortunately, that means that my fiance's family in Germany (apart from his parents) will miss the engagement party! 

That's why we're having two events, because either one side of the family gets left out or the other. 

My family is a LOT larger then my fiance's, which means the wedding in Europe will likely be pretty small and mostly filled with his family members.


That being said, the cost per head for the engagement party is really low. There's not as many expectations for an engagement party so I was able to skip out on a lot of the more expensive items. This means that I can afford to invite a lot more family than I would for the wedding. 

I'm now in a predicament where a bunch of my family and friends are coming to the engagement party who either A) Wouldn't be able to get to Europe for a destination wedding or B) Wouldn't have received an invitation for the wedding in the first place because I'm not as close with them. 

I don't want tell these people like "" Oh hey! Thanks for coming to the engagement party. You're my second great aunt who I've only spoken to once that my grandmother asked to invite you here, and I can afford to have you at this Engagement Party but not my destination wedding in Europe, so please don't expect a wedding invitation""

Or say ""Thanks for coming. Here is an invitation to a wedding I know you likely can't afford to attend."" 

Like.... 

What do I do :(

I'm not bringing my family. My only expenses are travel, dress, shoes, and lodging. I know everyone gifts a different amount but I'm looking for more of a general more or less than usual in this case type of vibe I guess. Thanks!!

She’s a great wedding planner and I’ve been blunt asking if there would be any conflict with her being both our wedding planner and our florist and her plans for covering the workload. She had a solid plan already outlined and confident answers. I like the idea that as my planner, she’s fully integrated with all elements of our wedding. However, I’m torn between going with the established florist and getting way less flowers or taking a gamble on a newer business that’s less established and hasn’t done many large weddings. 

For reference, our budget is 7.5k so it’s a sizable amount of florals. Both have given me quotes within that budget, so it’s just a choice of how much impact I want florals to make (and I would love to have lots and lots of florals)

And the bouquet? This one surprised me the most. Back in time, brides carried garlic, herbs, and spices for protection on their wedding day, and then eventually started adding flowers to mask the smell. Over time, those herbal charms turned into the beautiful floral bouquets we know today.

Even the old “tin cans on the car” tradition had a spooky origin, the noise was supposed to scare away any lingering spirits as the couple drove off into married life.

It’s funny how all these superstitions slowly became the sweet traditions we still love.

 I tend to speak/read a lot faster than he does, so at the ceremony my vows did not feel like they were dragging on as much as they were.

Based on a hunch and some photos the couple included with their wedding invitations, one of my daughters did some internet sleuthing last week and discovered that my son and his (now) wife actually eloped earlier, probably early this year or late last year. The evidence was totally convincing. I was and still am very hurt because:

* I wasn’t invited (later found out that his dad was present for it)
* I wasn’t told

The couple has portrayed this upcoming event as THE wedding. Not as a party to celebrate a prior wedding. There will be a ceremony with walking down the aisle, rehearsal day before, rehearsal dinner, reception, dancing, etc. His dad is the officiant.

I called him to ask him some questions. He’s been responsive to me lately (see below for explanation). He picked up the phone and I asked:

* If they had previously gotten married at the courthouse, and he said yes.
* I asked when it was and he told me the date. It was late last year.
* I asked who knew about it, and he said his dad, her mom, and a few friends. Her dad doesn’t know and none of the other guests know. (Both sets of parents are divorced.) Some family members from both sides are flying from far away to be there.
* I asked why the secrecy. They said that they didn’t want people to value the upcoming celebration any less.
* I told them that the upcoming event feels different to me. They indicated that anybody who thinks less of the upcoming event, in light of their elopement, that maybe such a person shouldn’t even be there. It felt like a veiled threat to disinvite me.
* They insisted that the prior marriage was just a piece of paper, that the only reason they got it is because he wants to be more involved in leadership classes at his church and the church doesn’t permit this involvement for people who live with someone they aren’t married to (they also have a son together). They insisted that this upcoming event is the real wedding.

I live across the country and don’t see him often. As a rule he is unresponsive to my calls or texts and has been since shortly after the divorce. It has been a little better lately but that may be because of the upcoming event and my willingness to pay for part of the rehearsal dinner. Over the years, the only immediate family member he acts like he cares about is his dad. Everybody else gets crumbs, not just me but his sisters too (especially one of them). The rare times we talk or I see him, I ask him why he doesn’t call or respond when I call or text, and he says he doesn’t know. I have asked him if it’s something I did or said, and he says no. I have my hunches as to why he keeps his distance (post-divorce parental alienation and enmeshment).

Am I crazy to be upset that this upcoming event is being portrayed as something it's not? That they are hiding important information from lots of people, some of whom might care? That they didn’t even tell me? HELP

**Edited 10/28 3pm after some feedback here and additional time thinking**: starting yesterday morning I had been wondering if I can even go and enjoy myself, but I do believe I can.

I’m not a wedding planner, but I work with a lot of couples while they’re booking venues and vendors — so I get to see all kinds of setups: big, small, traditional, modern, you name it.

One thing I’ve noticed is that the things couples *almost* skip often end up being what they love most later. For example, one couple nearly cut their live band to save money, but afterward they said it completely made the night.

So I’m curious — for those of you who’ve already had your wedding (or are deep in planning), what’s one thing you’re really glad you didn’t skip? Could be a vendor, a small detail, or something you didn’t think would matter but totally did.

(Also, I used ChatGPT to help clean up my phrasing a bit — I just wanted it to sound natural and clear 😅)

I need some advice/tips. 
I’ve been with my man 2.5 years - known him for 3.5
I wanted to do a a cheesy cute Valentines proposal (we have this running “commit to the bit” joke so because of it, I’m proposing to him, I love it) on 2.14.26 with then planning a wedding to be done on our 4th Anniversary (7.19.27) giving us a year and half to plan a wedding.

Here’s the kicker. His wonderful sister is dying of stage 4 colon cancer and things aren’t getting much better. Assuming 2-3 years tops. We are waiting for more information after some more scans the next couple months, and we are visiting in December and will be having more “death timeline” talk. She’s an amazing woman and already calls me her sister in law and I want nothing more than for her to be involved/alive during the proposal/wedding.

There’s a chance because of her timeline that things would have to be done faster/sooner, but budget wise we are still paying off a lot of debts right now so I’m worried. I technically have a “venue” at my college teachers house (we are very close and she has a huge yard a beautifully just painted black house which is 1000% my  aesthetic and really wants to help host this wedding because she helped bring my partner and I together)

*another small detail that yes seems a bit shallow but my partner and I are overweight, and the big thing was I wanted us to be in much better shape and healthier by the time we got engaged/married because I currently loathe the way I look, and want to feel confident and pretty on the big day and look back feeling good- not nitpicking all the photos. And we are definitely not there yet- and worried this won’t be achievable now with such a possibly short timeline*

Have ya’ll been through something similar ? What did you do? Thanks.

We are now a month away from the day and only a couple of friends know the plan as there has been no engagement announcement or talk of planning (not even with family).  Our families are very supportive, this has been something that we wanted to keep special for us though.

We are looking at having an ""Engagement Party"" after the Holiday season passes, something casual and laid back.  At the party we are planning to share our elopement video with our friends and family and announce our marriage.  We don't want people to feel obligated to attend a wedding and bring us gifts, we just want to celebrate our excitement with the people we care about.

Would appreciate input back on how you would receive this scenario as a guest.

\*\*Edit:  Thanks for the feedback all.  I do appreciate your input and will be discussing with FI whether to stay on course or make some alterations.  Main change will likely be ""Celebration"" or just a flat out ""We eloped"" invitation.

\*\*Update:  I wasn't expecting to be roasted this hard but I did ask for feedback and hear you guys.  I wanted opinions outside of my own and FI's and yes, a bit hard to hear, however, this is why I asked.  Discussed with FI last night and we are going to announce that we eloped right before invitations go out.  Invites will now say that we were married in a private ceremony with the location and date asking invitees to join us in Celebration.

Our goal wasn't to blatantly lie to anyone and I wouldn't want any of our friends and family to feel that way.

We will be showing a 3-4 minute highlight reel video of elopement and I don't feel bad about that, if someone has thoughts, they can have them.  I've been excited when friends/family share there memories with me and I will continue to do the same.   We are in our 40's and no longer have a large circle, our guest list is smallish (65 ppl) and consists of people who have the greatest impact in our lives.

When he was 6 months old I ran into her randomly at a library and reconnected. We had previously been best friends since we were 10 but hadn't spoken since high school, we are both 22. She was my rock, she pulled me out of that deep dark place and made me realize that who I had become was absolutely the best version of myself and that I was not burdening anyone with my new presence. Her bf (my fiances bm) was my fiance first dad friend and they do absolutely everything together, they call and videogame together on a daily basis and meet up at least twice a week to hang out with the kids. They were our light at the end of a very dark post partum tunnel and I will always be the most grateful for these two. I wish I could've been that for her when she had her daughter but the best I have right now is honoring them with this dance we have planned but like I said, nothing feels right.

How do you cope with anxiety after. We had such a fun and beautiful day a couple weeks ago. Ive seen some pictures and I am so nervous I will not like them, because of my hair. 

My trial went well, only wanted to center the bun, minimal change. I could see she looked at the picture of it while styling and seemed that it was going well. The biggest problem was she was late to start by 30 minutes and worked soo slow I ended up being a bit over an hr late by the time I finally got to look and see. She did not complete the style I requested at all. It did have a low bun but she changed the parts i wanted and liked about the original style, without showing or tellinf me. I thought we were on the same page, I was wrong.  Because I was late I knew there was not time for any re dos. I still had a 30 minute drive to the venue and needed to get my dress on. Looking ahead in the mirror i didnt think it was too bad. 

After our event, I had my husband take pictures after our private elopement to show my family my dress and then it really hit me of how bad my hair was. I feel so angry and disappointed with the situation. Im worried now that I will only see my hair when we finally get to see the photos. I really wanted to look back with joy and feeling so great about myself but these pictures have me shook. Is it as bad as I think? I wish I had a hair accessory to hid it but I liked my trial hair style so much I decided not to add to it. Hindsight tells me that would make it less awkward and embarrassing.

 My fiance (35 M) and I (29 F) had our bachelor and bachelorette parties this weekend, our wedding is November 14, so less than a month out. At the end of the night my bridesmaids and I ended up at my sisters house drinking and playing games and my fiance met us there after he went out with his friends. Once the party mostly cleared out it was myself, my sister, my BIL, my fiance, and my best friend (25 F). My best friend was being really really touchy with me and my fiance to the point my BIL asked if she was trying to take us both home for a 3 some or just him home. To which my fiance said ""Absolutely none of the above"" and said he created more distance (which my sister confirmed). At one point I looked over and she is trying to pull him to the ground by his pants and his face being pulled to her, he is repeatedly saying ""stop"" and ""What are you doing"", I was sitting there in SHOCK because it is SO out of character for her. I couldn't even speak to help him and I feel guilty for that and I ended up running out crying. Picture the one person you would think would be the last to betray you in your friend group, and this is her to me. My sister and brother in law agreed that my fiance did absolutely everything he could to stop her and honestly, if the roles were reversed, charges could be pressed--that is how bad it was. Then when he finally got her off him she was so mad at him she tried to kick him in the face? I don't even know how to fully describe it, I just know it felt like such a huge betrayal and that he did everything he could. Which of course I am happy to have a loyal partner, but just sad it came with someone else I never thought would do this all this. 

  
I texted her the next day (yesterday) saying I am so uncomfortable by what happened and that I need space to process. She was super apologetic and has been saying all the right things and told me she would respect my space and to let me know what she can do/what I need from her. She was extremely wasted but I just still feel like that isn't a good enough excuse? I have never dealt with anything like this so I am just so shocked. I guess I am curious how everyone would phrase handling this? The thing is, I don't hate her and I am not mad right now, I am devastated and so shocked still. I know she feels bad and I know this will hurt both of us to lose this friendship, I just don't see another way around it because the trust is completely gone. I actually think this is one of the ONLY things she could have done to make me not able to forgive her. She is supposed to be in my wedding and I need help with phrasing it because I truly am so sad and for some reason, I am still protective of her feelings in this because its going to be a loss for both of us. I haven't been able to eat anything since Saturday besides sipping on soup. I am at a loss and I need some help. So reddit, is this friendship ending? How would you gently get the feeling across that I am sad for both of us but this is what needs to happen right now?

It was perfect in so many ways, but this post isn’t about the day itself.

This year I started a new medication that really messed with my mental health. I stopped taking it back in August, but I’m still struggling with the aftereffects. Honestly, having a wedding only seemed to make everything harder.

Your wedding is built up as “the happiest day of your life,” and leading up to it everyone keeps asking if you’re so excited. The pressure to be happy is overwhelming and all-consuming. In the months before our wedding, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so emotionally isolated. It felt like I had to wear a mask of excitement every single day just to meet everyone’s expectations. And then there’s the guilt the guilt of feeling sad at a time in your life when you’re supposed to feel overjoyed. It’s a horrible spiral.

And after the wedding? The comedown hit hard. All that buildup and stress suddenly vanished, and I just felt... empty. Logically, I know a wedding was never going to erase my depression, but I think a part of me really hoped it would. When it didn’t, I was left feeling even more guilty about being sad.

I truly hope no one else has gone through this, because it’s such a lonely experience. Weddings are portrayed as the ultimate happy moment but struggling with depression while getting married feels incredibly isolating.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EE2C00>,self.weddings,

We are so thankful for the generosity of our parents, whose combined gift of $15,000 helped make our wedding weekend possible. We also want to acknowledge that we received thoughtful gifts and cash from guests who couldn’t attend — which was completely unexpected and deeply appreciated. I created a registry mostly because my fiancé’s side of the family prefers giving physical gifts, but we never assumed anyone would feel obligated.

Gifts we received from guests who couldn’t attend:
	•	Groom’s uncle: $2,000, plus an additional $1,000 after the wedding
	•	Maid of Honor: $500 cash (she couldn’t attend due to giving birth)
	•	Uncle: $150
	•	Close friend: $250 (couldn’t attend due to working visas)
	•	Copper saucepan: $300
	•	Le Creuset skillet, waffle maker, and French press: $350
	•	Immersion blender: $70

From guests who did attend, we received:
	•	$150
	•	$100
	•	$300
	•	$50 plus a serving set from our registry
	•	$300 sheet set
	•	$200

💡 Personal Touches

Some fun personal touches I added:
	•	Hand-designed 16 room numbers and dinner name tags.
	•	Hired 2 babysitters to watch the kiddos during the wedding ceremony then they joined us the rest of the night. Parents were able to relax. 
• On the dance floor, I took selfies with all the guests using my film camera — it was so fun and everyone loved it.


Guest feedback was amazing — many said it was the best wedding they’d attended. The pho I made was a highlight, and the DJ was incredible. The DJ is a professional who performs at clubs. His transitions were flawless. We agree with our guest and wish could have been guests at our own wedding!

⸻

🍴 Wedding Menu

All guests received 3 pasta dishes and eggplant parm, plus starter and gelato:
	•	Bruschettas
	•	Ricotta ravioli with sage butter
	•	Pumpkin Gorgonzola orecchiette
	•	Eggplant parm
	•	Pork ragu (vegetarians were provided an alternative)
	•	Gelato bar

⸻

🗓️ Weekend Recap
	•	Thursday: Welcome night with charcuterie, desserts, and wine — everyone crowded in the kitchen laughing and chatting.
	•	Friday: Chaotic but fun rehearsal dinner (saved by our photographer 😅). We played the wedding show game and it was a perfect way to end the night.
	•	Saturday: Perfect wedding day we got married in front of a 500 year-old magnolia tree and had an indoor reception. We danced all night long. I danced with every guest and took selfies. We ended the night next to the pool with a bottle of champagne. 🍾 
	•	Sunday: Recovery day! I woke up made pho for the entire villa. Then spent the afternoon lounging by the pool and sunset on the rooftop — the perfect way to wrap up the weekend.

Everything turned out better than we imagined. 💙

We keep everything as small as possible, without much celebration or support. Nevertheless, my greatest wish is to capture this moment in beautiful photos, simply as a reminder of the day when we were there for each other alone.

I’m a very type A person and have been planning my wedding since I was little. Planning is a fun activity for me - I love finding deals and booking. I think I’m actually going to be really sad when planning is over. I’m typically pretty sad after planning parties and vacations. I think to some it’s a bit weird that I enjoy it so much but I really do haha!

 Earlier this year I made the really tough decision to separate from my entire family. I don’t want to get into details but based on their actions I don’t want them at our wedding. I’ve always wanted a family that was more loving and supportive and it stings sometimes to see people in my life have that (I’m very happy for them and wouldn’t take it away from them, I just want it too). I don’t want my family there. I want the family I wish I had to be there. I understand that’s not possible and I also understand that I’m really fortunate to have an incredible partner, amazing friends, and a great future family-in-law in addition to so many other great opportunities I’ve had in my life. 

I’m struggling right now because 

1. It is going to be hard to not have a supportive family there when I’ve seen so many friends have at least a few members of their family show up and show them unconditional love on one of the most important days of their lives

2. We won’t have much/any financial support. My partner’s family isn’t in a place to give a lot monetarily and I think they would prefer to support us in buying a home so I’m unsure how much they’ll be able to give us. Which is 100% okay because they make up for it in how much they care and love us which is what truly matters to me. I just keep looking at the prices of everything and I have no clue how we’re going to pay for this just the two of us without going into debt. We have a lot of friends and cutting the guest list seems super hard if not impossible. We’ll probably end up with ~100 guests. 

It’s a bit overwhelming and sad because what was something I used to love and cherish now feels out of reach. It’s especially hard when I see people talking about how they can’t stand planning (not when they say they’re stressed about it but when they truly hate it). I love it and I want to plan an amazing day so badly but I don’t know if it’s in the cards and just the thought of that breaks my heart a little bit. I know there are much much worse things going on in the world and that me not having a wedding is a small problem compared to what others are facing. But it does make me quite sad. I wanted to post to see if anyone is going through something similar or if anyone has any advice on finding affordable vendors!

I’m trying to help my family sort out wedding blazers for a cousin’s wedding. It’s not just me there are a few family members who need something sharp but not insane on the budget. I usually shop local, but someone jokingly suggested checking Alibaba since they have bulk options for suits and blazers. At first, I thought “meh, Alibaba for wedding blazers?” but it actually makes sense if you’re trying to outfit several people at once.

That said, I have zero experience ordering formalwear from there, so I’m curious if anyone’s tried it and can share tips. How do you figure out sizing? Quality? Or is it just one of those “looks good in the photos, hope it fits in real life” deals?

Would love to hear suggestions for men’s wedding blazers whether if you’ve had a good experience with bulk buys. Comfort, fit, and style all matter more than the price tag, honestly.

1o5tmkg,Advice Needed - Destination or Not,4,0.58,129,adviceaccount_2,weddings,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddings/comments/1o5tmkg/advice_needed_destination_or_not/,/r/weddings/comments/1o5tmkg/advice_needed_destination_or_not/,2025-10-13 19:29:57,True,"Hello everyone, I could use a little advice.

I’m recently engaged, and my fiancé and I are in the early stages of planning our wedding. We’ll be paying for everything ourselves, so our biggest factor is cost. We’re 23 and 24, both just starting out in our careers, and we really want to prioritize buying a house. Because of that, we refuse to spend more than $15k on our wedding, and ideally, we’d like to keep it under $10k.

Here’s the issue: we both come from fairly large families, and they live in different states. We thought about hosting the wedding somewhere in the middle, like Hocking Hills, hoping that would help keep costs down. Unfortunately, based on what I’ve seen and been quoted, it’s been difficult to stay within our budget.

Last week, my fiancé pitched the idea of a tropical destination wedding. The idea would be to invite around 100 people, expecting maybe 50 at most to attend, and turn it into a vacation experience for everyone. We’re torn because we know this could put our guests in a tough spot, asking them to spend a few thousand dollars to attend, or not come at all. It feels especially hard for families with young kids, and we have a few of those.

So I’m looking for some realistic advice. I understand the pros and cons, but I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can spend over $15k to make it convenient for our guests, or spend under $10k and have the time of our lives, but risk excluding a lot of loved ones.

For context, I’ve never pictured having a huge, over-the-top wedding. Honestly, all I want is to marry him and start our life together. I’ve always loved the idea of a destination wedding, but I also love the simplicity of a backyard-style celebration, which is what we’d do if we went with Hocking Hills.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EF4200>,self.weddings,

I think I’m do like the idea but I am not really one to overtly stray away from tradition . When it comes to being walked down the aisle I think I want two people to do so , my dad and grandad. 

I haven’t actually been to that many weddings myself and don’t know how much of a common thing this is . Would I be totally going against the grain, this would have to be a separate convo for both my grandad and dad , do you think that this would be insulting to my dad?

I only say as I know he recognises the distance between us and how he would want to be enough or something special between just me and him and this would make it painfully clear for everyone involved that I feel like I he hasn’t always been that main father figure in my life.
has anyone had a bad reaction if doing so. 

Me and my dad have a good relationship just not the closest probably speak once an month on average for a check in for about an hour, my mum and dad split when I was a baby and I had no contact for about 8 years. But we’re comfortable and get along well and there is lots of love for each other on both sides. 

my grandad (mums side) we lived next door to and was a present male figure during that time. 

My grandad is in his seventies and my mum (his wife only child ) never married so I feel like that we would both appreciate the experience but he would never assume that role as he would deem it not his place unless I asked. 

There both quite traditional men in there own different ways but so I just think this would maybe be very odd to them both unless I asked them both too and I don’t know if maybe there would be any hidden hurt if I did / not ask.

Naturally, this means most people will need to plan quite far in advance if they’re able to come. Bc of this, I was thinking of including a poll along with our 'Save the Date's' - something like *“do you think you’ll be able to make it?”* with options: yes, no, maybe. The only purpose of this would be to get a rough sense of numbers to help with early logistics. Clicking ""yes"" wouldn't be a 100% intention to come, but at least it'd signal an intention to. Logistically, I can work with that - even if they ultimately don't turn up! 

I was quite sure about this strategy early on - however, since then, multiple people have warned me that this carries the risk that guests will be less likely to formally RSVP later; if they feel like they've already responded, why bother again?

We have s’mores as a dessert too so I think they could definitely snack on graham crackers as well. ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EF5C70>,self.weddings,

1nyarqs,Need ur opinion,71,0.95,496,Ok_Foxxy,weddings,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyarqs,/r/weddings/comments/1nyarqs/need_ur_opinion/,2025-10-05 01:00:25,False,"Good evening! I have three venue options for our 2026 wedding, and we haven’t decided yet.

The first venue is in another city — it’s more expensive and doesn’t include the cake, heavy smoke, or fireworks, and for drinks, it only offers three cocktails.

The second venue includes almost everything in the price and is cheaper. It doesn’t include the cake, though. I find this location much more elegant, but at the same time, it kind of looks a bit like a conference hall… or maybe it’s just me. Here, we can also have the traditional hangover soup the next day. My husband and I would have a free room here, so the next day we’d just wake up and go downstairs to eat, basically.

The third option has the lowest price, and they really include everything — from the cake to the wedding dress. The only thing is that I don’t like the chairs, and it looks a bit outdated… but it offers the most services and a very wide selection of drinks.

What do you think?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EF5EB0>,reddit.com,
1ny517c,What to do with our baby?,74,0.72,295,,weddings,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddings/comments/1ny517c/what_to_do_with_our_baby/,/r/weddings/comments/1ny517c/what_to_do_with_our_baby/,2025-10-04 20:45:54,True,"My fiance and I just got engaged last month! However, we’ve been trying for a baby since February. Unfortunately we haven’t had any luck. But of course, a week after engagement, I test positive 😅
Of course we’re both excited! However, getting 2 things that we want at the exact time is a bit stressful. We even talked about pushing the wedding further, but we still like the idea of our current date.
Our chosen date is in October 2026. Baby should be coming late May/early June. That would mean the baby would be roughly 4-5 months old at that point.
So my question is: has anyone had that young of a child that close to their wedding? What did you do? We threw around some options, but wanted your guys’ opinions or any other options.
1) Baby is in the wedding, as a ring bearer or flower girl, being aided by another family member.
2) Baby is not in the wedding, but present and having a family member babysit throughout the night.

Those 2 options are nice, but we also know that my fiance and I will be fairly busy and even if we have a caretaker for the baby, there could be disruptions. Not that we’re prioritizing the wedding over the baby, but it is a factor.

Option 3 is having the baby stay home with a babysitter while we’re busy with the wedding. And though that seems like the easiest, it also feels weird to exclude our little one on such a big day. We could also have them attend the ceremony but no reception?

This is all so far in advance, so I know we don’t need to worry about it yet. But I just want to know what others have done in this situation. TIA!


UPDATE
Thank you for all your feedback! We really like the idea of having our baby in the ceremony with a babysitter and then going home after photos, so we’re leaning towards that. But, as some of you have pointed out and what we’re keeping in mind, is that obviously we have no idea how the baby will be temperamentally. So we’re still going to prepare for other options, especially depending on the feeding situation at that time.
The stress of a pregnancy and wedding planning is also something we’re keeping in mind. Personally, I love wedding planning. Yes, it can be stressful. But I’ve always enjoyed planning my own and helping my friends, as well. Now, will pregnancy hormones change that? Possibly, and of course we don’t want that to negatively impact our relationship or the pregnancy. Which is another reason we’re looking to hire a planner, and/or to change the date!
Some of you had mentioned getting married prior to baby arrival, or at least signing the papers. I found (with my previous marriage) that a year is the perfect amount of planning time, and anything less could bring on more stress. We are also not in a rush to sign papers, so we’re pretty firm on the marriage either a year from now or longer. We’re not super opposed to pushing the wedding another year. Luckily we haven’t put money down on anything yet, so we still have time to move it to 2027 if that’s what we want.
Also kind of on that line, dress fittings were brought up a couple times. That’s another reason we’re not looking for the wedding to be before baby arrival; but I wasn’t thinking that my body could possibly take that long to bounce back. That is something I’m now thinking of!
A honeymoon was brought up a couple times as well and that is not something we’re planning right now. We’ve talked that it’d be better for us to go on our honeymoon the following year, and that was before we even discovered we were pregnant.
Thank you again for all your suggestions, you guys definitely confirmed some of our hesitations about some of our options! ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EF5FD0>,self.weddings,

We’re getting married in 7 days and we have pocket squares for the groomsmen. They are wearing dress shirts and vests only. One of theirs vests doesn’t have a pocket at all. I’m trying to think of a way to fold the pocket square into a flower shape and then pin it on like a fabric boutonniere!! 

Not using the pocket square is not an option unfortunately. I need help with figuring out how to fold it and secure it onto the vest…. I don’t want it coming undone and floppy midway through😬😬 ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36EF6210>,self.weddings,
