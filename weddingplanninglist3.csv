1obnhrt,35.5 K CAD Vancouver Island Fall 2025 Budget Recap (Long),1,1.0,1,sookfong,weddingplanning,https://i.redd.it/2smxhqt5rawf1.jpeg,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1obnhrt/355_k_cad_vancouver_island_fall_2025_budget_recap/,2025-10-20 16:52:42,False,"Full disclosure my husband and I were gifted back over 20K from our Chinese-Eastern European/Canadian wedding, and so our total out of pocket was 13K. We also were not relying on the gifted money, and were planning on paying everything ourselves.  However, I hate when we see recaps that go “10K wedding but actually my family paid for everything but the venue etc so it’s really a 30K wedding”, because that is completely unattainable for people who do have a hard 10K limit.  This is going to be long.

Context that is important: we are in our thirties with dual income, high earners in a very low cost of living area, because we get to take our Vancouver salaries and work remote. We own our home, we had decided to get married in 2023, and had to wait until 2024 to lock in our venue but had reached out and gotten 2023 or 2024 prices for all of our vendors. We also weren’t looking to save money/cut corners, this was truly a “I like it, I buy it” situation, which may not be realistic to everyone. Please don’t expect money saving tips from this. Our wedding was very much, if we, after all these years, are going to do this (because in BC married and common law have the exact same protections), we are going to do what we want–which apparently lines up with eight year old birthday party plans. 

We did still get married in a high cost of living city because of practicality for literally all but 6 people who would have to cross the ocean. We went over our budget by 10K mainly because of how underquoted we were for catering, as well as how many children some friends had (two had additional children we didn’t know existed), and people who travelled who we didn’t think could.

In Depth Breakdown

Venue Budget: 5K Actual 5.69K
The Venue was our second serious venue consideration–the first was out of our budget, and truly was everything we wanted and loved. This is a community centre, which pricewise great, the downside is that they only let full venue rentals book one year in advance (so you book for 2025 in 2024), with partial being only available in the start of the current year (if you want a 2025 wedding but only partial you have to book in 2025). We did a full venue rental which got us access from 09:00-24:00, but could store things in the loading bay the day before and day after. The rental also came with use of tables and chairs, as well as set up for those. For an additional charge we could use their audio visual equipment-however that is only available on the top floor, so we had to rent additional equipment for the downstairs ceremony.

When we originally booked, we were booking with a woman who is no longer with the venue. She was extremely frustrating to deal with, often only answering one question per email, even if you sent a numbered list, called out each question in separate paragraphs etc. We asked for floorplans, specifically calling out the ones on their website did not have dimensions and she…just sent us the ones on the website.

Starting in 2025, a new venue coordinator stepped in and she is a godsend. The first email she sent to us introduced herself, and included floor plans with dimensions and a checklist of what we still needed to provide her as well as the remaining payment schedule. She has consistently been a breeze to work with. Her staff, truly amazing to work with. 

Additional things we needed for this venue was Event Insurance (3 mil liability 92$)and a Special Event Permit (24$ though I needed to get my Serve It Right cert (20$) to get this not counted because in case I go through a major career change, I can now also bartend)


Photographers Budget: 4K Actual 6K
My husband found them, and while they are based on the mainland, they do travel to the island often.  We chose them for a specific image in their portfolio where they had captured someone’s father, just so full of joy so candidly that it was enough to sell us on them. And seeing the photos they got of our family during the ceremony—instantly the right choice.  We found out much later, they’re actually huge award winners for various wedding industry things, which we don’t care about but is cool.

After an absolute shitshow of interviewing photographers (including one where they made a reddit post about me), these two beautiful people were a godsend. They were on the same level of anal as my husband and I, and also appreciated the amount of nerd we could shove into an entire eight hours. 

This was for 8 hours, two shooters, an engagement shoot and travel because we live on an island. 

Catering Budget: 6K Actual 10.5 K
This is so conflicting for us because the food was literally amazing. And yes, I could be biased, but chicken that isn’t dry the next morning when you eat it without microwaving it that tastes better than the lunch you eat later, is a hard bar to beat.

They did not blink when we said we loved mac and cheese and Korean Fried Chicken and instead got it on the menu. Truly amazing food, we did family style and there was so much, and the chicken was so tender.  Even more so the day after, when I finally got my appetite back. More importantly, we wanted to make sure there was no othering and that vegan food was served and shined just as well as animal based and it was amazing. They also, without us knowing made the vegan mac and cheese gluten free after they saw that one of our guests was gluten free. My sister cried at being able to eat mac and cheese.

Their staff, including their head server, were godsends. The head waiter did so much that wasn’t in her job description–getting table wine out on the table that forgot to be put up. Fixing a percolator–which 100% was not her job. Packing to go food for me because I was too amped to eat–people who can eat at their weddings, bravo to you, I wanted to. It took two days before I was able to eat food like a normal human again. 

This was for four passed apps, a four course family style meal, and a late night snack

However, they very much underquoted us. We did get a quote for 80 people and in fact ended up with 96, including vendors, which when we did the back of the napkin math, we expected to come up to 9K.  We were not expecting them to add a fourth chef and a fourth server. They also had to add another stove rental, which we were not expecting. They suggested us taking over the rentals and paying the rentals directly instead of paying them to do the rentals which would save us a percentage of the tax, which honestly would not recommend. That was entirely stressful and the maybe 100$ is not worth it. 

Communication/admin skills are not their strong suit. I am self admittedly a type A project manager, so expect strong communication and have high standards, but even my type B partner agreed that their radio silence and several week delays with emails was troubling. Most frustrating was that within 60 days of our wedding, we had emailed them asking how they would like the guest list numbers, and allergies sorted and we didn’t hear back for over a month–this left us scrambling within the last 30 to get a final invoice which went through multiple revisions due to errors in math.  This wouldn’t prevent me from working with them again, because the food and service so amazing, but it would be remiss of us not to bring that up.

Desert (Pies) Budget: 300$, Actual 342$
A microbakery in our hometown. She learnt how to make vegan pie dough which was the extra charge for 12 pies.

Bartenders Budget: 1.5K Actual 2K + 1.5K Alcohol 
We did go with the premium bartenders on the island, for 5.5hours of service, with three specialty cocktails.  They were far and away the easiest vendor to work with.  We had three cocktails-Leave it to Cedar (Gin based), Proper Etiquette (Vodka based), and the Orange Ginger Mojito (Rum based), as well as various wine and beer.  The Proper Etiquette and the Mojito could also be made mocktails, and the Mojito was the drink of the night–everyone was drinking that one. They supplied all glassware, ice, and non alcoholic drinks

They also stocked Phillips Root Beer for me–my favourite root beer ever and one of the best moments was when we got into the reception, someone asked me what I wanted and I said a root beer and the head bartender had one in my hands before I blinked. 

Because of the laws in BC, they could not supply the alcohol but instead they gave us shopping lists.  The Alcohol budget was 1K and we spent 1.5K we could have spent much less. The 1.5K is the total after all the returns we could do and refunds. 

Coffee Bar Budget: 1.4K Actual 1.1K
Our original coffee cart had to pull out due to family issues, which left us scrambling (seven months ahead) to find a coffee cart. Coffee is a big part of our life, so we wanted amazing coffee service during cocktail hour.  I believe we were their first wedding, but a smash hit. We had a limited menu with iced matcha lattes, chai lattes, artisanal drip coffee, and tea. She also very kindly agreed to make the milk lactose free and she picked up donuts for us. The donut was amazing and it was such a good time. 

This was for two baristas, for 6 hours and we got a 100$ discount because their expresso machine broke and was not going to be fixed in time. 


Music Budget 460$ Actual 300.12$
My husband is anti DJ because he is a music snob, and he curated multiple specific playlists, mixed them himself and synced lights to the music. Most of this is the SOCAN fee we had to pay, plus an extension chord. He spent about thirty hours doing this. It brought him joy and a killer dance floor. My mother in law offered to pay for a DJ, which we turned down because of his playlists.

Live Artist Budget: - Actual 300$
Wedding planning was a complete joint effort between the two of us, but this was the only vendor I booked without telling my husband. She came up as a rec in my local Wedding Facebook Vendor review group and I immediately ran to her. 300$ for 6 hours is an insane undercharge. 

 She took photos of all the guests and painted them a little favour to take home. She also very kindly let some of the kids sit beside her and paint using her supplies. Best part of the day.

Flowers: Budget 500$ Actual 630$
This is for a bouquet, a boutonniere and flower preservation. This is also the vendor that I am holding off posting my wedding vendor reviews in my local facebook group until I get my flower back. This florist is the highest rated on the island and is very popular. 

The florist who did our flowers was amazing. We had several meetings and it was clear in both our contract and our calls and emails that my mother in law would pick the flowers up the day of the wedding at 10:00.  So imagine our surprise when the Friday before the wedding we got a call that we were late for the pick up. 

The flowers we got on the Saturday, were clearly older but had been in the fridge so they were fairly fresh. We assume they were made Thursday night, instead of Friday which already was a mistake. 

We have paid for bouquet preservation and were told multiple times that the flowers had to be at the store Monday morning ASAP, and kept in water or the fridge to extend them as long as possible before they got preserved. My mother in law was there at 10:00 when they were open per the website and no one was there. She waited an hour, calling the store, calling me and looking for answers. There was no note or anything to indicate that they would not be open their regular hours and no one had told us ahead of time this would happen. 

I called the store several times with no answer, and finally ended up emailing  the florist who called me back and asked us to leave the flowers at the nearby coffee shop.  I have not yet seen what the preserved flowers look like so will withhold judgement on that but somehow this was the most stressful vendor we had to deal with and it was all within the 72 hours of the wedding. 

It also took them over a week, plus two follow up emails for them to acknowledge they actually had my flowers from the coffee shop. 

Officiant Budget 100$ Actual 250$
We used the BC Marriage Commissioner list to find the officiant. He did the job, and was pleasant. We had signed up for a custom ceremony, but at the beginning he seemed to push us to his basic prefab one, sending us two of essentially the same scripts where he had just changed the names, which was not like us at all. He did accept our custom ceremony and performed it well. We are married.

However. he told us that the cost for perform the wedding was going to be 250$--while the website states it’s 78.75$ with tax, and then milage at $0.63/km as well as 25$ for every 25 minutes extra work of the initial hour he worked on our ceremony. We were in mid August and our wedding was end of September so I didn’t have the space to push for further accounting on this–I highly doubt there was any extra 25 minutes of work put into this since it sounded like he read it for the first time while performing, nor that there was 100$ worth of milage. He also emailed us at 02:00 the morning of our wedding saying he lost our booking form and he needed us to send it to him again.

Attire:
Dress: East Meets Dress Budget 800$ Actual 1.5K 
Bought before Trump’s Tariffs and the 51st bullshit. I would have found a Canadian designer otherwise. Dress is fine, unexpected custom costs (147$) as well as more alterations than expected (300$ of the 1.5K), as the now 40$ credit East Meets Dress offers has to be claimed within 20 days of delivery.  We took the dress in as I had lost a lot more weight than expected, and then moved lace to the sleeves to make it more romantic/less hard lines. I wore Birks I already owned

Suit: Indochino Budget 700$ Actual 1K 
Suit was 550$, custom made. However my husband had not tried on his suit for six months since it showed up until the Sunday before our wedding (6 days), and turns out he lost a lot of weight, so we had to get a rushed alterations job (467$), where they took the suit in apparently three sizes. He was so thrilled about this.

He also bought new shoes for 40$, which he will use for work.

Rentals Budget 500$ Actuals 1.5K
I alluded to it before, but the bulk of this rental came from the caterer's catering stuff (so not plates and forks etc but tables and ovens and serving dishes).

We agreed to take the 989$ rentals from the caterer to save 200$ on tax and really we shouldn’t have. That made us responsible for those things when they disappeared-like 200$ for linens that they had to make their tables holding the food look nice. As the customer, we wouldn’t have cared about those at all, but we still had to scramble to find them (packed away in a random tote) and then drive three hours back to the city we got married in.

The remainder was the things we knew we had to rent (table settings, high chair and booster seats). Pro tip, don’t offer high chairs or booster seats unless your venue offers it. We realized after people accepted that the venue didn’t supply them. 


Misc: 519$
Invitations/STD/Signage: Budget 200$ Actual 207.98$
My sister is a graphic designer/illustrator so she designed these. This cost includes the font package we bought, the printing from Vista Print, and the bulletin board that the large signage (Day of Schedule/Seating Chart) my mother did hand calligraphy for. This does not include stamps, because I love to send letters and send 10 letters a month, so we just buy stamps in bulk and just took it out of the normal stamps deposit we have. 

We have not yet done the Thank You cards because Canada Post is maybe on strike? But an expected 15$ for photo printing and 20$ on multipack of cards. 

Rings: Budget 80$ Actual 94.17$
We bought Silicone Rings, because we love to hike, and my husband is an amateur carpenter.  We find silicone better for day to day life for us. Our engagement ring(s) are also silicone, though I also have a metal pink sapphire one that I wear leaving the house.

Marriage Licence: Budget 124$ Actual 100$

Wedding Insurance: Budget 150$ Actual 94$
Had to have it for the venue, would recommend you have it anyway. 3Mil liability

Special Event Permit: Budget 500, Actual: 24$ 
Literally had no clue how much this cost. I just put in a big number when budgeting and it appears it was very off. There were no easy numbers to ballpark in BC online. 

Decor: Budget - Actual ~$200
So this is the crapshoot. In the not great for human rights, we used Temu. My husband did a lot of Temu math to get flowers, and other random craft supplies. There were coupons on coupons and we got money back if anything went on sale after we bought it, plus a lot of credit.  An example of Temu math: we bought all our linens for 126$, however we had a 50$ and 20$ credit that was applied so the charge on the card was 56$ Shipping was delayed so we got another 5$ credit, applied to that and then there was multiple price drops so we got down to 27$ for linens after all that Temu math. 

We cannot accurately track the amount spent vs the credits we got to balance the scale. 
We used vases we had already, plus some dollar store vases that my mother in law bought us for the wedding, without telling us.  We also used our existing Muskoka chairs for the sweetheart table, and while we did buy Edison bulb exterior string lights for the dance floor, we did buy the exterior ones purposely for our patio and as such didn’t count that expense for the wedding.

Our theme was Star Wars and Dinosaurs, and my husband has spent a lifetime collecting random Star Wars things, so we can’t give any estimation on that because inflation and also all the years collecting. The dinosaurs were all picked up at garage sales by my parents in large bags filled with dinosaur bags over the last two years and I spent 30$ spray painting them. My mother estimates spending less than 10$ on them. 

 We put 200$ because we know the arch cost 70$, and we will resell it, and are just assuming we spend at least 100$ on random fake flowers which will live in our house forever.  

TLDR:  We spent a lot of money, I may be fighting my officiant and florist in small claims court. We had a great party.

 My only marriage advice/wedding planning tip: wedding planning only exaggerates what your relationship is, and your marriage doesn’t suddenly become different or better because you got married. The weeks and months after my wedding, has been the same as it was before, but with less wedding planning stress.  If you are having constant breakdowns or fights with your partner, or feel like they are not helping with the wedding planning, those issues (root causes) do not just disappear once you have a party or sign paper.

What I loved about that place was that it was luxurious, reviews said it had amazing food and drinks, and multiple venue options.

  
We have gotten in contact with a company called Hola Weddings and they say they will, for free, help find a resort and work out a room block and then anything wedding related, the on site wedding planner will help. Has anyone worked with this company before and have reviews? Or a similar company offering the same services. I feel so overwhelmed by the different options!

I would also love resort recommendations and why you do/don't recommend having your wedding there. These are a few things on our checklist:

* Be able to host about 75 people, budget is around $35k
* Family friendly resort (ideally a focus on adults only but still allows children since we will have a 15 year old attending)
* Outside venue options that are not on the actual beach, private
* 5 star, luxurious vibes (on par with Atelier if possible)
* Top tier food and drinks

We got married this past weekend, and it was everything we hoped for and more. Couldn’t be happier with how it all turned out. This subreddit was super helpful (though sometimes stress-inducing; more on that below). It was also interesting to follow all Wedding Reddits from a male perspective, since I've concluded that most of them skew female. For context: it was a gay wedding, and I did most of the planning since I work in project management (my husband’s a teacher, so his schedule is less flexible). But wanted to share some reflections, as I know a lot of you have done the same and wanted to assist where possible!

Quick Details:

Location: San Francisco, CA

Guest count: 172 (200 invited, which included people we knew couldn't come but still wanted an invitation). Most of the no's were my parents' friends (and they still sent nice gifts so win-win). Only 3 post-RSVP cancellations, and it happened with 3 weeks to go. Our final count wasn't due until 4 days before the wedding.

Vendors: Hotel Wedding (including catering and all rentals), Wedding Planner, Florist, Photographer, Content Creator, DJ, String Trio

Cost Coverage: Day of wedding costs were split 50/50 between my parents and me. My husband's family covered our welcome party, and my husband took care of the DJ. We were also fortunate that my parents own a jewelry store, and my husband's mom owns a signage company, so we were able to save some money here.

Here are my big takeaways:

**1. Be careful with Reddit rabbit holes.**  
I found a lot of great ideas here, but I also stressed over things that never became issues. Example: we didn’t get to taste cocktail-hour hors d’oeuvres, only salads/entrées. I saw a Reddit post about someone whose tasting was amazing but whose reception food was awful, and I got paranoid that it would happen to us. Of course, it didn’t. Lesson: use Reddit for inspiration, not for worst-case scenarios.

**2. Child-free was the right call.**  
We had about 60% of guests fly in. I worried people with kids wouldn’t come, especially since some friends had newborns or multiple children. Adding kids would’ve made the wedding unbelievably expensive, and we couldn’t make that work in the budget.

To my surprise, everyone still came. My group of friends alone made up 63 guests and most of them are parents. I think a lot of them looked at it as a rare weekend away, especially since we’re among the last in our circle to get married (I’m 35, my husband is 34). There aren’t going to be many more chances for this kind of gathering, so people made it work.

We did have our siblings’ kids involved in the ceremony, but we arranged for a babysitter at the hotel during the reception. The one small compromise was allowing kids at our welcome party, mostly locals who just brought their children along.

**3. Protect your headspace in the final weeks.**  
By the end, I was mentally drained and over second-guessing every decision. I found myself just wanting it all to be *done.* I recommend setting boundaries and giving yourself breaks from constant wedding talk.

**4. Alcohol: simpler worked fine.**  
If there was one part of venue negotiations that drove me nuts, it was alcohol packages. I don’t drink, and my husband’s a one-beer-at-dinner type, so it always felt like we were being gouged. The venue packages gave us sticker shock, but we compromised with a tiered approach: liquor and cocktails during the cocktail hour, wine with dinner, and just beer and wine during dancing.

This decision made me anxious because a lot of my friends are big drinkers, and I worried it might come across as stingy or restrictive. We also didn’t want anyone to get sloppy drunk and have it affect the vibe. People still got fun drunk, nobody seemed to care about the “limits,” and I think everyone had a great time.

**5. Vendors: vibe matters most.**  
Do your due diligence, but prioritize the people you connect with. You’ll spend so much time with them that good energy is essential.

**6. Officiant: keep it cohesive.**  
Our officiant was one of my close friends, who’s also become close to my husband. We sent him our vows ahead of time so he could make sure everything flowed together. It worked perfectly — people raved about how natural and meaningful it felt.

**7. Wedding planner: grateful, but maybe overpaid.**  
We had partial planning (resources/checklists + more involvement two months out). I want to clarify that this isn't a slight to our wedding planning team. Our team was amazing, and I couldn't say better things about them. However, with a hotel venue (no rentals, in-house catering, and fewer vendors), I don’t think we needed such a robust package. I got paranoid because at my brother’s wedding years ago, they got a fairly inexpensive day-of coordinator. I ended up managing small fires all night and didn’t want that for our families. With that in mind, that's why I went with our package, but I think I could’ve gone with a lighter package and had a similar result.

**8. Registry: Honeyfund worked well, helps offset costs**  
We did a Honeyfund/cash registry since we’re old enough that we don’t need household items; and honestly, the only thing I usually splurge on is travel. It was great because it acted as a catch-all, but since we tied it to my Venmo, I didn’t keep the money earmarked only for the honeymoon. Instead, I used a lot of it to help pay off wedding bills. And that’s fine: I’ll still spend what I want on the honeymoon, and the gifts won’t change that.

It’s not even the fun decisions like colors or themes. It’s all the back-and-forth with vendors, trying to keep the budget straight every time RSVPs change, and figuring out backups when plans inevitably shift. I feel like I spend half my evenings buried in emails and spreadsheets, and it’s starting to feel like a second full-time job on top of my actual job.

We’ve been using The Knot to try and stay organized, and while it’s helpful for checklists and inspiration, it doesn’t really save me from all the vendor emails or the constant budget updates. For example, when our guest list changed recently, I ended up reworking everything manually anyway and it still felt like I was doing most of the heavy lifting.

The other night I was joking with my partner, saying: “Why can’t there just be something that actually handles all the boring logistics like the vendor calls, the budget updates, the scheduling, and then just checks in with us for the big approvals?” It would keep us in control but take away the endless admin.

So I’m curious… what platforms or tools do you all use for DIY wedding planning that actually help minimize the stress? Does something like this already exist, or are you just piecing things together manually?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35CB8DA0>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist
1nbfqqm,Did our planner absolutely bomb or were we expecting too much,12,0.72,39,Intelligent-Stand847,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1nbfqqm/did_our_planner_absolutely_bomb_or_were_we/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1nbfqqm/did_our_planner_absolutely_bomb_or_were_we/,2025-09-08 05:52:30,True,"Just want to know if this is absolutely absurd that these were missed or if this is somewhat within normal things that go wrong at weddings/ if we were just expecting too much from our planner. 

This was for a partial to full service planner, I guess more of a custom package because we already had most of our vendors contracted/picked out by the time we hired her. We hired her a year out from the wedding for organizing/budget/overall planning, day of coordinating and design. We dropped the design component with her half way through because I realized I was just doing it myself as she just wasn’t being very responsive in that department and I realized I just wanted to do it myself anyway. 

And for context this was a tented wedding, with an onsite house for getting ready/bridal party to sleep at, and after party venue was on site as well. So everything in one spot. Planner had a team of 4 people on site day of. I thrifted all of the decor (plates, vases, table centerpieces, cocktail decor etc). All reception decor was very well organized and labeled by bins (like cake cutting stuff was all together and labeled in one bin). On my end, I definitely could have been more organized with cocktail hour decor. So I’m not even including cocktail hour in this list of things that the planner messed up because I’m owning that I should have been more organized on that end. But reception/guest table decor was absolutely nailed down and crystal clear.

Also for context I didn’t notice MOST of these things day of. I absolutely loved my wedding day and had so much fun. We had a wonderful day despite all of these issues. It’s just looking back at pictures that I’m realizing how badly our planner messed things up. But I’m not letting this ruin my memory of the day. It’s just that I’m wondering if we need to speak up for ourselves and call her out on this and leave an honest review for others. 

Here are the balls that were dropped: 

Didn’t confirm that the correct dance floor was on the order sheet with rentals until weeks after we discussed it so we had to pivot to a different style because the original was no longer available. Not a big deal but this is just the start. 

We payed for 2 full size linen samples for a table design meeting (2 different linen patterns) and only one was brought to the meeting. I really wanted to see if both patterns matched the vibe of the items I had started to thrift. Also the sample/table design meeting lasted all of 20 minutes and it just felt like we were being rushed through it. 

I caught multiple mistakes on rental orders- our guest count dropped significantly and I was the one that caught that we were about to pay for extra linens for tables that we didn’t need. Would have cost us over $600 if I didn’t catch that mistake since we were renting upgraded linens.

When booking hair stylists, I had to follow up multiple times to see if the planner had found any options yet, and eventually I had to just find a stylist myself because we were only a few months out and she still hadn’t given us any options yet. 

At one point my makeup artist sent me an email saying that our planner was not responding to her emails and she couldn’t get a hold of her. We should’ve taken all of these early signs as a clear warning but we didn’t. We did express our concerns at one point but she got more responsive after that so we thought we would be ok to keep going forward with her.

At the rehearsal-  NOTHING was prepared. I had to quickly try to pull up the correct procession order & music length even though the planner was on that email thread. I didn’t have my phone with me so we ended up just having to guess the timing for the procession songs based on my memory. Rehearsal was an absolute mess. 

Planner also didn’t count how many seats to reserve for grooms side- and instead left two entire front rows reserved/ empty when grooms side only needed half of one row reserved. So grooms parents were sitting the furthest away from the aisle because they didn’t know where to go so they just sat themselves politely to the far side thinking that other people might still be filling in the other seats. So there were basically two full rows of empty seats right up front on the grooms side which, for one, just looks stupid in pictures but more importantly his poor parents were unnecessarily far away from the ceremony when they could’ve been front and center in clear view. I honestly didn’t think that that was something that I needed to tell her to do. 

The planner didn’t check in with me (bride) AT ALL the entire day leading up to the wedding. I didn’t see her until after the ceremony. I was late getting started with my hair and makeup because I lost track of time. So I missed a big window of pre ceremony family/bridesmaids photos and I was late to the ceremony. Is it normal for the planner to not see/ check in with bride at all the morning/ day of the wedding?!

We did DIY flowers, but the plan all along was that the planner would set the florals out on the tables. That was part of the plan during the interview/ hiring process with her. My sister was a former florist and she gifted us the flowers/labor. I thrifted every single flower vase so they were all different, but I sent very specific pictures for how the tables should be set up with the each of the vases. In addition to the pictures, each vase had a sticker on the bottom with its table number on it so that she would know exactly which vase went on which table. I tried to make it as easy as possible, and she said she was all set and ready for it, never indicated an issue with it. My family didn’t see all of the thrifted vases before the wedding and even they were saying how organized and easy I had made it with everything being stickered and labeled. My whole family spent an entire day making table arrangements with these vases. We then also filled some basic clear glass bud vases just to have as extras ( Amazon bud vases, not thrifted, nothing special, just to have as extras if needed). Looking at pictures I’m seeing that our planner mostly just put out the clear glass bud vases. The bud vases were to be used as fillers if any tables seemed a little sparse - which I had specifically talked about with her. The next morning I saw that a huge amount of the actual arrangements we made in the thrifted vases never even made it out to the tent. Every picture/video I can see of guest tables has the clear bud vases and does not match the instructions/ pictures I had sent. Like not one table that I’ve seen so far was correct with the thrifted vases. I organized it so that certain vases went on certain tables to match the thrifted plates on that table so that each table felt cohesive. And I wanted to put certain vases at specific tables based on guests at that table- for example I had a specific vase labeled for my parents table because they used to have the same vase in our house when I was a kid. Maybe this all sounds crazy but I put sooo much energy and effort into each table. And every single vase had a sticker with its table number so I did everything I could to make it organized for the planner to take over. 


Head table was also the most sparse table in terms of florals. Totally empty space around bride and groom in all of those photos. For an 20 person table it had just 4 single bud vases and only 3 of the thrifted arrangements. We made several bigger flower arrangements specifically for the head table, and I had picked out my absolute favorite thrifted vases for the head table. I spent a full year sourcing all of these vases from thrift stores and I absolutely adored each vase. And instead from what I can see in photos she mostly just put out the clear glass Amazon bud vases and only a couple of the thrifted vases. I literally didn’t notice this on the day of because I was just so happy to be getting married. But when I look at pictures the only flowers you can see around the bride and groom is my bouquet that I just happened to drop on the table in front of us. Like not even the bud vases are near us. When I texted her the day after the wedding asking why all of the arrangements weren’t put out she tried to say that the ones left behind were the extras. There were about 30 or more arrangements in thrifted vases that didn’t get put out. And again what she did put out were mostly the basic Amazon clear glass bud vases instead of the special vases. I’m absolutely CRUSHED that such a large amount of the vases I spent an entire year sourcing didn’t get put out. And my family spent SO much time making the flower arrangements, AND my family bought all of the flowers for us as a wedding gift. I was sobbing the morning after the wedding when I realized what happened, mostly because I was just so embarrassed that I let my family put so much effort into those flowers just to have the planner totally drop it. Obviously with everything being thrifted that’s a very unique situation. But I also have a huge family that loves to help out and I said all along that if she ever needed extra hands that my immediate family would be SOO fast to jump in and help. At one point my sister tried to go into the reception tent to check it out and they turned her away. If she had noticed that they were running out of time to put all of the flowers out she absolutely would have jumped into action and gathered my family to help put the rest of the flowers out. But instead it feels like the planner was just trying to hide what was happening. 


Ok moving on from my flower sob story. 

No one from her team gave me or my husband the cue to start heading over to the ceremony site. We both had to catch the time ourselves and realize that it was probably time to head over. 

So- nobody from her team gave me a final once over before walking down the aisle, so we missed that my dad still had his sunglasses on for the walk down the aisle. I guess this maybe isn’t a specific job for the planner but I just feel like that should be standard service? Like if I’m paying someone to be detail oriented isn’t that a pretty important moment to be focused on the details? Again I saw the planner for the very first time that day after the ceremony was already over. And she had a team of 4 people there that day. Not a big deal I guess but also you only get that moment with your dad ONCE. Obviously those are really emotional pictures and his eyes are covered in them all. And he did not mean to keep the glasses on. He feels horrible about it. 

For our guest book, we were going to do a Polaroid station for guests to take pictures and put into the guest book to sign. She offered to bring her Polaroid so that we wouldn’t need to buy a new one. Her camera was BROKEN. You literally had to smack it around to get it to MAYBE take one picture out of every 10 smacks, and all the pictures are blown out and blurry. We obviously would have just bought a new one rather than have that whole station be useless. 

This is a small thing- but we were so caught up just being the bride and groom and hosting that by the time the dinner toasts started, we realized we didn’t have any champagne poured, so we didn’t have a drink to toast with for the speeches. Obviously that doesn’t really matter but again would’ve assumed that that might be standard for any planner to take care of? 

We didn’t have forks for our cake cutting so we had to eat it with our FINGERS. I also literally made a note in her planning platform that she would need to grab forks from catering for us for cake cutting. I mostly put the note in there as a joke saying that I did not thrift forks since I was thrifting everything else. Obviously I assumed a planner would think to put forks on the cake cutting table. But come time for cake cutting and we had no forks. Also in the cake cutting box I had included a tray for us to put the cake cutting utensils back down on and that didn’t get put out either. So we had to put the dirty serving utensils on top of the tablecloth and it’s stained now. It was a thrifted tablecloth that I was planning on keeping. Obviously I’m still keeping it and will still use it but it has a giant oil stain on it now. Not a big deal but that’s why I put that tray in the cake cutting box. And I had uploaded a picture of what we wanted the cake cutting table to look like in her planning platform. So all decor for cake cutting was in a box, labeled, and she had a photo of the set up. 

She also brought out the wrong cake. (We had a large sheet cake for guests, a two tier cake for cutting, and a single tier cake as a backup in case the two tier fell apart on the drive up to venue). A bridesmaid told me that the planner tried to bring out the large sheet cake for us to cut because she didn’t know where the other cake was. Bridesmaid didn’t know the difference between the two tier and the single tier but that wasn’t her job to know. Planner knew, we had discussed it. When I saw the single tier was brought out I had to ask her to please get the correct two tier cake. We had gone over the cakes on previous calls. She knew we had the large sheet cake for guests, the two tier for cutting, and the single tier was just a backup.

Also the photographer was eating dinner when planner originally called us over for cake cutting. I only noticed that after I told her to swap out the single tier for the two tier cake when I looked over and saw that the photographer was sitting and eating. So if we had cut the single tier when she wanted us to the photographer would have either missed it or would’ve needed to jump up and run over for it mid meal. 

She also asked me for my phone at the end of the night for the after party playlist. My phone was buried somewhere in the bridal suit and was also dead so it had to be charged before we could get the music going. So we had like 20-30 minutes of no music for the after party which obviously kinda killed the vibe of the party. I thought she had the playlist on her phone. 

In my mind, the cake cutting and after party music issues would have been solved if she had checked in with me even ONCE before the ceremony. Like she waited until it was time for cake cutting before she realized that she didn’t know where the cake was, and then panicked and tried to bring out the sheet cake. Thank god one of my bridesmaids was inside to intervene. It’s a wedding not a retirement party. And for the music, if she had gone over her checklist for the day and realized that she didn’t have the after party playlist she could have gotten that from me earlier in the day. 

The morning after the wedding we also discovered that none of the vases were put away the way she said they would be. She said she would pack everything back up in the bins so that all we would need to do is load our bins into our van and leave the venue. All of the china/ glass/ vases were thrown haphazardly into half broken down cardboard boxes/milk crates. Not at all wrapped back up in the bubble wrap it came in. She offered to pack it all back up neatly for us. I absolutely would have made a plan for packing it back up ourselves if she hadn’t said she could do it. So we were extremely late checking out of the venue because we had to pack all of that back up ourselves. 

Couple of other things I just thought of:
We paid for an extra premium linen to be used for the dessert table and I’m almost positive it didn’t get used. ($120 linen rental). I can’t confirm for sure without seeing pictures but I do remember being at the dessert table and not seeing it. Again that was a specific conversation with her. 

We ordered bridal bouquets and boutonnières from a florist. The boutonnières were supposed to be for just the groom, best man, and the dads (FOB, FOG, step dad). Planner knew this. But planner put the boutonnières on all of the groomsmen instead of just groom and best man. So dads didn’t get any. Again we went over this in a meeting with her.

And we had a pre-ceremony cocktail hour, and guests were supposed to start heading up to ceremony site obviously well before ceremony start time/ before bridal party started to head over. But when I looked out the window before I went outside I saw that all of the guests were still mingling. I had to send my sister out to start telling guests to head over to the ceremony site so that I could go outside and start the procession. I was about to just walk outside right into all of the guests. 

Oh and she also said that someone from “the staff” broken a marble slab we had brought from my parents house to use a part of the decor. It’s ok that it broke, it’s heavy and bulky to move around and it was just a random slab that we had. But still. It was somewhat sentimental. And it’s just bizarre that she can’t just say “I broke it/ we broke it” and is trying to distance herself from it by saying “someone from the staff”. Like it would’ve just been her small team of 4 moving it. 

Again individually most of these things are not a big deal but when you add all of them up together I’m just overwhelmed at how many things she messed up. I’m wondering if I’m just being overly picky or if I’m right in that this planner absolutely dropped the ball and if we need to speak up and complain. 

And as I wrote this I went to log into her planning platform just confirm that I had in fact uploaded all of these pictures/ instructions that I’m referencing and… she deleted all of our information. Blank page. Maybe that’s standard to delete after the wedding is over…. Or is this all so outrageous that she knows she messed up and is deleting everything so I can’t go back and point to it?

But this company failed me last weekend and I want other brides to make sure to not use them 

I used FM for my wedding on Sunday… i had family and friends out early for the wedding ready to help and eager to help. I took off from work to dedicate time to the flowers. I did so much prep work getting all the supplies and making checklists for making sure we recovering everything, outlining all the special prep for specific flowers, and printing out recipes for all the arrangements.  

I was supposed to get 4 boxes of flowers and only 1 showed up on the intended delivery day of Thursday. I frantically emailed FM and they basically said to chill out, drink some wine, and in the “rare” cases flowers don’t arrive on time they will arrive the next morning. Next day comes and only 1 other box arrives. This is 2 days before my wedding and on Saturday I had my rehearsal, my rehearsal dinner stuff, and had to finish packing and transporting decor  - I didn’t have time in the schedule to arrange all of my flowers beyond my bridal bouquet. THANKFULLY the flowers that hadn’t arrived were flowers I could get at a grocery store so we went and bought those and did the arranging. All while hearing NOTHING from FM the whole day. I asked them what to do, I asked them for help with the flowers that had arrived late that were super open. RADIO SILENCE. Literally these people emailed me for weeks telling me they’re here to help and answer questions and they’ll be closely monitoring the tracking. Nope! I was completely alone and had to run to 4 different grocery stores to get what I needed. 

At 9pm Friday night the 3rd box arrived but with FMs care instructions I wouldn’t have been able to even start arranging with those flowers until 10pm. 

The last box is set to arrive today lol- 3 days after my wedding. 

Eventually FM responded and just said sorry and that they’d refund me for those flowers but they really didn’t offer any advice or answer the questions I had sent about the flowers I did receive. 

I wanted to like FM, I was excited about them and confident but they really let me down and added to my stress. I really suggest to never use them- and if you do have a back up plan on where you’ll source flowers. 

My flowers turned out beautiful and everything worked out in the end but it’s not thanks to FM - it’s really thanks to my friends and family who were so on top of helping me and my husband get what we needed. 

If I were to do it again I’d maybe just use FM to get a custom design plan and then just source the flowers elsewhere bc my designer was great.

I am just coming out of 2 months of a major grind period within my doctoral program, and realized this weekend that I've not felt very excited about the wedding in a while (definitely related to a lack of time and energy due to school and work!), and have been looking at it more like a work project that needs to be managed and gotten through. 

With only 6 more weeks to go, I really want to shift away from seeing the wedding as a bunch of spreadsheet rows and columns to manage, and be able to look forward to seeing so many loved ones and getting to marry the person I love the most in the whole world. My goal on the day-of is to be present and joyful and would love that to start now! We have an amazing month-of coordinator who will step in starting next week, so I'm hoping that helps take a lot of the logistics planning off of us, but would love some ideas from those also in the final stretch or who've already had their wedding! 

One thing I thought of was planning some dates to some of the places he and I went at the beginning of our relationship (have one on Saturday!). My therapist also suggested putting wedding planning items that aren't time-sensitive into a jar and pulling them out at random and then going on a date afterwards. She also suggested doing something similar with guest names and telling each other stories about them and why we're excited to have them at the wedding. 

What else can we do to bring some fun and excitement amidst the checklists and emails?? TIA <3",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35CB92E0>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist

I got a engaged in late June of this year and my fiancé and I are getting married next June. 

We’ve been focused on locking in all of our vendors and are now finally settling down to look at the guest list, floral inspo, and I have a dress appointment next month. We’re following checklists from the popular sites and are on time or early with most things. 

Several weeks ago found out that my mom had already purchased her MOB dress. It didn’t match the color palette we were thinking and we haven’t even officially chosen a color palette yet. It’s also a very bold print. And effectively a ball gown. After a few weeks she started talking about getting alterations so I worked up the courage to tell her I didn’t think the dress (all jewel tones, every color you can think of, in a loud pattern) was right for our early summer wedding where we how now finally decided we are mostly going with pinks and oranges. She flipped and said it’s so hard for her to find anything she likes because she hates her body.

I’ll also say that I haven’t even remotely decided what I am going to wear. I don’t know how over the top I want things so be, and our venue is a warehouse. It’s highly possible that I could go with something simple, tea length, or even a sleek jumpsuit or suit. There’s so much about her ordering a literal ball gown without even mentioning it to me before she committed that bums me out. 

We had a conversation about it where she apologized for making the wedding about her and I told her the same dress in a lighter color would probably be fine. We pick one, and when it comes she tries it on and says she hates it and really likes the first one. Just when I thought we were making progress we’re back at square one. 

Over the next couple of weeks she sends me a bunch of dresses and I finally ask if she would be okay with waiting until I try on dresses and she stops responding. No further comments have been made about it. 

Around the same time I initially found out about the dress she offered by fiancé and I a sum of money for the wedding. Gracious, and unnecessary, but we said thank you and told her how appreciative we were. It is super kind and I’m not NOT happy that she offered to do it. Her love language is gifts and I try to keep this in my brain but with this next bit in mind it’s hard. 

Within minutes of offering us this money she said “and when can I give you my guest list” ugh. She has a few girlfriends I expected her to want to invite but she also gave me a list of five or six other people. One of them is her best friend who is an alcoholic and who no one in my family is politically aligned with. My fiancé and I are both sober and we’re serving limited alcohol at the wedding but trying to not invite people we know could go too far and ruin things for us. I initially said no and then said I would think about it. 

Today while hanging with other members of my family I brought up inviting her best friend so I could ask if I would also need to invite her daughter and if she would expect/need a plus one. Before I even got to asking the question she snapped and said “if this is about [name] she’s invited, I’m inviting her to this wedding” when I tried to defend myself my brother who I’m hoping will be our officiant jumped in to defend my mom. It just frankly sucked. 

I’m feeling so defeated knowing this is how things are going just a couple of months into planning.

1my5xf0,[recap] Experience and Tips for DIYing my wedding flowers,31,0.96,3,Ok_Jello_2441,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my5xf0,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1my5xf0/recap_experience_and_tips_for_diying_my_wedding/,2025-08-23 16:27:21,False,"Hi brides! I graduated June 28th in Washington and wanted to share my experience doing my own flowers. 
Doing my own wedding flowers was both the most exhausting and the most fun part of wedding prep. I’m so grateful for all the friends who pitched in to make it happen.

For context: I’m a gardener but never formally studied floral design, still I always dreamed of creating my own wedding flowers.
	•	For the ceremony arch and area, I used faux flowers. They looked good in photos, smelled like nothing but were stress free, hung them up in 30 minutes and done.
	•	For anything close to people such as bouquet, centerpieces, and bud vases, I used fresh flowers for the scent and life they bring.


💐 TODO checklist
	•	12 centerpieces
	•	1 bridal bouquet
	•	4 bridesmaid bouquets
	•	20 bud vases
	•	1 groom’s pocket square
	•	1 Bloom Bar (a little flower station for guests to make mini bouquets)


🛍️ Flower Sourcing
	•	Most were bought from FiftyFlowers. I went with them because I wanted some very specific premium blooms. The flowers were very high quality and customer service was great, but delivery was stressful. Flowers need 2–3 days to hydrate before arranging. Our wedding was Saturday, so I scheduled Thursday delivery to the Airbnb. FedEx refused to release the package that contains my most expensive flowers (Juliet roses and garden roses, $$$) without a signature, even though the host left a note. Delivery was delayed by a day, which left us scrambling and super tight on time.
	•	I also bought small quantity specialty flowers at Town & Country Market (Seattle folks, highly recommend their floral department, they will special order rare stems and the manager is wonderful).
	•	Out of panic about not getting my roses, I grabbed some garden roses from Trader Joe’s on Friday and luckily scored some late season peonies, I still believe it’s one of a best places for DIY brides especially if you’re flexible with the color and type of blooms! You can really get all you need for $300-500
	•	Total spend was about 1500 dollars. Seems like a lot for DIY but keep in mind the specific premium blooms cost ~$200 per 24 stems on their own. We also did end up buying way too much and I think the cost could’ve been brought to ~$1000 had we been more strict in our estimate, so we gave tons away to guests and staff at the end. Still worth it to see everyone happy.

✂️ The Making Process
	•	Prepping flowers is a lot of work, do not underestimate the time and effort it takes and I’d dedicate 1-2 hours just for this: de-thorning roses and stripping leaves where they’ll be held or go underwater, then they need to sit in water for 24 hours for best results 
	•	For center pieces we used 4 inch wide bubble vase, I wanted low set vases so they’re not in the way of people conversing. Because they’re wide mouthed, you need a tape grid across the opening to hold stems in place, low vases are not the easiest to work with and it takes a lot more foliage and blooms to fill out than one would imagine, if you want a easier time arranging I’d recommend narrower mouthed vases
	•	For my bridal bouquet, I wanted the feeling of holding the whole garden in my arms. Big, lush, alive. My hands are small so I couldn’t grip a huge spiral bouquet. Instead, I made a little wire ring, slipped my fingers through, and crossed stems through it for support.
	•	Due to the delivery hiccup, we had to be setting up the venue AND doing the flowers the day before the wedding which was kinda chaotic, took all 8 people in my wedding party to help me for 2 hours straight 

The experience was honestly super intense but also super memorable and fun! My flowers turned out exactly how to envisioned them and 
I’m super proud!


🌸 Tips for Other DIY Brides
	•	Practice ahead
	•	It’s way more work than you think. Don’t plan to DIY on the actual wedding day, you’ll need a crew. I thought I’d make my husband’s pocket square on the morning of, but it was so crazy then I completely forgot 😭
	•	Bouquets wilt fast in heat. Mine was a little droopy by the ceremony. Between photos and the ceremony, keep it in water in a cool spot.


Would I do it again? Yes, 100 percent. Exhausting, but one of my favorite parts of the wedding.",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35CB9610>,reddit.com,wedding checklist

Our wedding day was full of joy, laughter and emotional tears, well beyond anything we had imagined or expected. All our vendors delivered brilliantly and got 5 star reviews from us. Our guests were overwhelmingly complimentary about what a wonderful day it was.

I joined Reddit 10 months ago looking for wedding planning advice and I've learnt so much on the wedding subreddits, both what to do and what not to do! So this post, sharing what worked for us to achieve a hugely successful wedding, is my thank you to other wedditors and I hope you find it useful.

For context, we're a mature couple (both over 50), neither of us has been married before. I Ied on the planning, just because I have more free time, but we both have project management experience, which has been beneficial. I'm used to budgeting, creating and using Excel spreadsheets, breaking a big task down into small manageable actions, keeping track of milestones and delivery progress, and managing relationships with suppliers (vendors) - all of which I've done A LOT since last autumn! So my advice is that if you're ever offered project management training at work, take the opportunity to do it, even if it doesn't seem relevant or exciting at the time, because you never know when or how it might be useful in your personal life!

TOP TIP

We agreed wedding planning ""mantras"" up front, which for us were:
 
1) We don't overthink it;
2) We don't overcomplicate it;
3) We don't second-guess ourselves;
4) When we know, we know.

I can promise you that these worked phenomenally well for us throughout all of our wedding decision-making. If ever we were going down a rabbit hole of analysis paralysis or getting overwhelmed, we pulled ourselves out of it with one of these. I recommend that you come up with helpful mantras for your own approach to wedding planning, or just use ours if you like them!

THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP - HOW AND WHERE TO START

Initially we spent about a month doing the equivalent of project scoping and defining our requirements. This is an ""invest to save"" activity that I highly recommend. Spending time up front getting really clear about broadly what success looks like saves so much time down the line in missteps, mistakes, misunderstandings and (sometimes) wasted money.

Defining your vision and decision-making criteria

We talked a lot about what we each envisaged for our wedding:
What experience we wanted to have, what experience we wanted our guests to have, what our ideal wedding vibe was. 
What was important to us in a venue and (equally important) what we really didn't want or need. 
How big a wedding we wanted and broadly what kind of guests we both wanted to invite.
When did we want to get married - we had a couple of special dates in mind. 

I wrote all of this into a short (1.5 sides of A4) requirements document for venues. The wedding we had last month exactly delivered this set of requirements, and well beyond in terms of the overall experience. 

Doing your research

As neither of us had a clue what was involved in planning a wedding we got a book on kindle but didn't get past the first chapter, which set out a very useful timeline and checklist. Apparently we were already behind a typical wedding planning schedule but we trusted in our ability as a couple to get it done within 10 months. 
The checklist gave us all the building blocks to consider and formed the basis of our plan. There are lots of wedding planning resources online - lifting a pre-existing timeline and checklist rather than starting from scratch has to be the way forwards, especially if you have no prior project management experience.

Setting your budget

We went online to get an idea of wedding costs and to check what we could realistically expect for our money. 
In the UK https://www.hitched.co.uk/ and https://bridebook.com/uk do annual wedding cost surveys and publish reports on average total costs, regional cost variations, the range of costs for each type of vendor, and what you can expect at the top and bottom end of the price range. I'm sure similar companies who provide an online marketplace for wedding venues and vendors exist in other countries and will provide similar, incredibly valuable, data.
Using all that information, including checklists of what questions to ask venues and each type of vendor, we set a mid-range budget for London weddings, that was affordable for us without contributions from family.

FINDING YOUR VENUE

We didn't start researching venues until we'd done all the above. It amazes me when I read posts from wedditors who are touring venues within a week of getting engaged. How do you even know what you're looking for or how much you can spend so quickly? 
We only researched local venues that were the right size for our guest numbers and flagged as mid-price range on Bridebook. 
We looked at venue websites and read reviews. A score of less than a 4 out of 5 overall meant we weren't interested. We always read the negative reviews even for high scoring venues - sometimes criticisms on areas you don't care about don't matter, but one or two negative comments about something that's a deal breaker for you might mean it's best to look elsewhere. 
The manner in which venues responded to our initial approach and requirements document also influenced how we viewed them - you can always tell which of them have really read and considered your brief and which just give you a boilerplate response.
We requested sight of pricing packages if these were not online and got our shortlist down to five venues, all very different but which on paper could deliver our wedding requirements within our budget - a dedicated wedding venue, 2 hotels, a converted gothic church and a pub.

We visited them all in a week and chose our venue based on our emotional response - one of the hotels kept us both awake imagining our wedding there. When you know, you know!

FINDING YOUR VENDORS

It's so much easier to look for vendors once you know what your venue is, because it works if they are both vibe-appropriate and venue-appropriate. 
Our venue was Victorian and beautiful and our function rooms were white with mirrors, corniced ceilings and chandeliers, so, for example, a lot of floral decoration would have been gilding the lily but what it did need was splashes of colour. So I chose to have 5 strategically placed and impactful pedestal arrangements in my favourite flower colours - yellow, orange, cerise and peach. It took me about 5 minutes to make those decisions. 
We also chose a retro-style staffed photobooth because a shiny neon self-service booth would have looked out of place in our venue.

We found some of our vendors through a wedding fair at the venue and others through online research. For us, whether we liked them was a key decision-making factor. Were they people who ""got"" us, who we enjoyed interacting with? Were they friendly and flexible? If we found someone we liked, who could do the job, had 4 or 5 star reviews and who we could afford, we didn't carry on looking for someone better or cheaper, we booked them and moved on to the next decision. We were always budget conscious, but aiming for value for money rather than the cheapest option.

Always trust your instincts - they can promise you the earth but if your gut is telling you not to trust them, or if you don't like the way they communicate with you as a potential client, walk away.
Don't forget, if it looks or sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
And do read the smallprint in the contract before committing. What's missing? Do you have reasonable protections or is it very one sided in their favour. We negotiated changes in the venue and photographer contracts.

The feedback I got consistently from venues and vendors was that they really liked our clarity. They liked receiving a written brief from us because it meant they knew what and how to deliver what we wanted. Clients who constantly change their minds or who simply can't express clearly what they want can cause vendors all kinds of issues.  

DO YOU NEED A WEDDING WEBSITE?

Having a wedding website was brilliant, and a lot of fun to create! For me it was definitely worth using a premium service with online RSVPs and the ability to download the guest list, menu choices and seating plan into an Excel spreadsheet that we could send to the venue. It saved me HOURS of time, effort and potential stress.
Writing the catering brief and working out how much prosecco, wine,  soft drinks and evening snacks to order was so much easier to do using this downloaded information.
Our guests did seem to read our website, eg. they all turned up on time wearing outfits in keeping with the dresscode. Only 2 guys contacted us with questions in the fortnight before our wedding. And I think giving people online travel directions they can access on their phones is definitely the way to go.
We used https://gettingmarried.co.uk/ which links with a great stationery company, https://www.dottyaboutpaper.co.uk/, who did all our stationery and signage to match our website.

WORKING AS A TEAM

Whether you like it or not, your communication and teamwork around the shared endeavour of your wedding is a precursor for your married life. You'll learn a lot about each other, including how you handle stress, your approach to money, and how you manage family interactions etc.

Although I was doing the implementation, it was super important to me that this was ""our"" wedding not ""my"" wedding. 
My now husband is brilliant at online research so he led on that and found  our venue, wedding website, ceremony readings, DJ, cake topper, my HMUA and several other elements of our wedding logistics.
We made all significant decisions together.
He reviewed and commented on anything significant that I wrote to send out to guests, venue or vendors, and especially the proofs for anything printed. He always found something helpful that I'd missed because I was so deep in the details.
The only thing he didn't much care about were the flowers, except that he had a strong aversion to flower arches, so I made the decisions on floral decorations (no arches!).

I copied a great suggestion from another wedditor of booking a regular wedding planning session, so for months we met for two hours every Saturday or Sunday afternoon, sometimes in the pub, and went through everything together, doing research on our phones, and making immediate decisions. It was fun!

Our wedding day fully reflected who we are as a couple, not my personal aesthetic as a bride, and was all the better for it.

CONCLUSION

There is so much more that I could write on wedding planning but this is already too long, so I may post some other top tips separately. I really hope the above is/was helpful, especially if you're recently engaged and not sure where to start.

I wish you all the best for your wedding planning, and hope that your wedding day goes wonderfully well!",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35CB97C0>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist

It might be a long shot, but I was wondering if anyone else has had their wedding there and if they’d be willing to share any tips and tricks they learned on their journey. 

A little background: 
We booked the petite package (20 people included + an optional 20 more people) and we’re coming from the USA

Some questions (some Auchen specific, but others are more general) 

- would you share your wedding planning checklist? Things like when to book external vendors, and when to apply for visas and such. 

- is the owl meet and greet worth it?

- any questions you made sure to ask the coordinator/planner

- Any vendors or food you absolutely loved?

- Any requests that helped your day feel more special/flow smoother 

- we’re not big on dancing so thinking of an alternative for that

Any advice welcome! Thanks in advance!

1mffk3j,"A long, overly-detailed, and extremely opinionated summary of my wedding planning experience, mostly focused on budgeting (July 2025, PNW, 125 guests)",79,0.98,31,Herculaya,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1mffk3j/a_long_overlydetailed_and_extremely_opinionated/,/r/weddingplanning/comments/1mffk3j/a_long_overlydetailed_and_extremely_opinionated/,2025-08-02 02:44:35,True,"I wrote this up as a way to remember every detail from my wedding planning experience, but I hope it is helpful to someone to share it here!!

**General information about the wedding:**

* 11 month engagement (engaged August 2024, Wedding July 2025)
* Saturday wedding in the Pacific Northwest (mid-sized city, medium-to-high cost of living). 
* “Full blown wedding” aka ceremony, cocktail hour, reception with dinner, dancing, and open bar, wedding party, etc. 
* 189 invitees, 125 Yes RSVPs, 124 final attendees.
   * 56 local guests and immediate family (almost certainly attending) vs. 133 guests traveling in.
   * Calculators estimated that 122 would attend. Pretty close!

**Original budget lower end:** $40,000

**Original budget higher end:** $55,000

**Final cost (just wedding):** $40,340

**Final cost (including welcome party and our travel costs):** $55,150

# 1. Deciding the budget:

The very first thing we did was set an ideal/dream budget. Before we thought about guestlists, locations, venues, or wedding parties, we asked ourselves “**How much is a wedding day** ***worth*** **to me? How much of my money will I** ***happily*** **spend on this?**” The answer for me was $10-15k, ideally $10k. The answer for my husband was $30-40k, ideally $30k. We had this conversation knowing that we *could* go above this number, but this was the *dream* number. So $40k became the goal. $55k became the higher end. 

We didn’t receive (or expect) much financial support from our families, but if we did, this is when we would have added that to the budget. 

>Providing a caveat on wedding budget vs. household income because I think all of these numbers are sort of irrelevant if I don’t disclose our overall financial situation: $40-55k was the amount we were comfortable cash-flowing (a.k.a. it could be paid from our paychecks over the course of the 11 months we were engaged, with no need to dip into savings/stop saving.) We make about $400k/year combined, pretax. So could we have scrounged together more than $55k? Absolutely. But I think we would have been so stressed and unhappy about it and would have wondered if we were wasting our money.

>We are very lucky and privileged to make the money we do and have what we have. Our families are not in this position, but quite a few of our friends are. There were a couple of times throughout the planning process where my husband worried we were “cheaping out” relative to our income/our circle of friends - some of them have definitely spent 2-5X what we spent on their weddings. But I think we were able to throw a beautiful wedding with most of the bells and whistles, especially with respect to guest experience. I honestly would have felt weird inviting his family and my family to a more extravagant wedding just because our friends had one. Our wedding felt very *us* in the end.

This is the most important piece of wedding advice that I can provide: **If you spend every dollar you have ever saved - or money you do not have - on your wedding, that will cause you stress and strain.** Setting our budget at a comfortable amount for us saved us so much heartache and made the whole process more enjoyable, even when we inevitably went over budget. It allowed us to be more open with the guestlist. It allowed us to not take things personally when they didn’t go our way. It meant everything on the day didn’t have to go perfectly. Planning the wedding has been an overall enjoyable experience for me, and I think this is the #1 reason why. 

# 2. Finding the venue:

The single most impactful factor in sticking to our budget was where we chose to have the wedding. We were originally considering Mexico City, Los Angeles, or the NYC metropolitan area based on where our families live/are from and where we live. We quickly realized that if we wanted to stick to the higher end of our budget and get married in one of these places, at a decent venue, we would have to have less than 50-70 attendees. 

* **Mexico City:** 
   * We reached out to the wedding planner a friend used there and he essentially told us we wouldn’t be able to have a 100 person wedding for less than $60k all in (including welcome party/day after brunch etc.)(Casa de la Bola was the main venue we were interested in for anyone curious). We decided that this was probably not a good idea for us. We were aware that starting at $60k would quickly turn into $70-80k.
   * This was the initial dream that we are now really happy didn’t happen. With everything going on with Trump/immigration we would have felt awful asking some family members to travel out of the country and cause stress just to attend our wedding.
   * Destination weddings get a bad rap (kinda deserved IMO) but our close family and friends expressed disappointment when we chose the PNW over Mexico City, including PNW local friends and family! They all said they’ve always wanted to go but never had a reason.
* **Los Angeles:** 
   * Gorgeous wedding venues that would have put us way over budget (my favorites I researched were La Venta Inn in Rancho Palos Verdes which would have been at least $60k for just the venue/catering, and the Natural History Museum which would have been a minimum of $35k for venue/catering). 
   * One big pro here is that you don’t have to have your wedding in the summer, you could pick a different time of year (we knew we wanted summer weather for the wedding)
   * We had one friend lose their wedding venue to a fucking landslide (okay I’m being dramatic, it was structural integrity issues/risk of landslide) (it was the Wayfarer’s chapel, incredible venue) just a few weeks before their wedding. And then with the fires. All this to say that this is the only reason I’m glad we didn’t pick LA. I would have worried so much about a disaster.
* **NYC/NYC metropolitan area:**
   * My husband really wanted to get married here. This is where we live and I’m sure it would have been incredible.
   * Venues we considered:
      * Bryant Park Grill, which would have been at least $80k for just the venue and the catering. 
      * Unitarian church in Brooklyn followed by the Center for Brooklyn History (church would have been $2k, Center for Brooklyn History is decently priced but they require you to use the same caterer as all the luxury venues like the Prospect Park Boathouse and the NY Public Library, so my best estimate for venue + catering was $45k minimum.)
      * We considered renting out a restaurant, but the costs were high and the spaces were small and meh everywhere I looked. 
   * A few months before the wedding we decided we’d be moving to the other side of the country a few months after the wedding. On one hand, it would have been a beautiful finale to our years in NYC, the city where we met and fell in love. On the other hand, I’m sort of happy to be done with it and have our wedding be the beginning of the rest of our lives on the West Coast. 

I think a major reason we were able to stick to our budget is that **we didn’t tour any of these venues in person**. I can totally imagine us visiting any of the above mentioned out-of-budget venues, falling in love with it, and having the budget fly completely out the window. I’m really happy we didn’t do that. Definitely get at least an approximate quote from a venue and make sure it’s do-able *before* going to see it. 

**Last note about cities:** We probably could have found cheaper venues if we were willing to go further outside these cities, but my number one deal breaker for the wedding was that it had to be within an hour of a major international airport. Our family and friends are so spread out that no matter where it was, at least 70% of the guests would have to fly in. I have been to weddings that were 3-5 hours away from the nearest major airport and I’m so sorry if this offends anyone, but it is all anyone remembers about those weddings, and as a guest I heard grumbling about it before the weddings, during the weddings, and after the weddings. I didn’t want that to be the case at mine. 

**So how did we decide to get married in the PNW?**

It wasn’t initially on the list because while I love it, I don’t spend that much time there. And my husband had only been there like 3 times in the 4 years we dated before getting engaged.  But once we made a first draft guestlist and broke it down by where people lived, the PNW became a major contender. 

* Mexico City: 3%
* Southwest: 3%
* Middle US: 7%
* Outside the US (besides Mexico): 8%
* The South: 11%
* California: 15%
* NYC area: 25%
* Pacific Northwest: 31%

The fact that it had the highest number of local guests made it an obvious contender once we broke it out like this. There were also personal reasons that made it make sense and while it wasn’t the original plan, it was one of those things that once we decided, it just felt *right*.  

In the end it really came down to finding the right venue. I would love to share and recommend my venue to other PNW brides, but it is a school that doesn’t usually do weddings and only let me because I am an alumna. Our venue fee was $2k, which is a steal for the spaces we got, but keep in mind that we had to rent **everything**. On top of that, there were a lot of restrictions on what we could do due to it being a “historic” location and not a traditional wedding venue. 

From the beginning I thought it would be nice to have the wedding at a nonprofit of some kind - most likely a museum or a garden. I figured if we’re gonna spend some money might as well have it go to something like that. So the restrictions in place at our venue were also in place at most of the venues we looked at. 

# 3. Estimating costs:

This is a difficult step. I bought some books about wedding planning, and the one I recommend the most is the Little Book of Wedding Checklists. It included so many things I never would have thought of. I got the below cost breakdown from that book:

|Line item|% of budget|Share of $40k|Share of $55k|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wedding planner or coordinator|5%|$2k|$2.75k|
|Venue and catering (including venue, all rentals, catering, alcohol, and cake)|50%|$20k|$27.5k|
|Photography & Videography|12%|$4.8k|$6.6k|
|Reception Entertainment|7%|$2.8k|$3.85k|
|Transportation|2%|$800|$1.1k|
|Ceremony (officiant, music)|2%|$800|$1.1k|
|Attire and beauty (dress(es), suit, hair and makeup)|8%|$3.2k|$4.4k|
|Florals and decor|8%|$3.2k|$4.4k|
|Gratuity|6%|$2.4k|$3.3k|

# 4. The final budget:

|Line item|% of budget|Share of $40k|Actual %|Share of $40,340|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wedding planner or coordinator|5%|$2k|6.41%|$2,585|
|Venue and catering (including venue, all rentals, catering, alcohol, and cake)|50%|$20k|52.18%|$21,049|
|Photography & Videography|12%|$4.8k|9.82%|$3,961|
|Reception Entertainment|7%|$2.8k|1.34%|$539|
|Transportation|2%|$800|0%|$0|
|Ceremony (officiant, music)|2%|$800|0.74%|$300|
|Attire and beauty (dress(es), suit, hair and makeup)|8%|$3.2k|19.13%|$7,715|
|Florals and decor|8%|$3.2k|6.61%|$2,665|
|Gratuity|6%|$2.4k|0% (included above)|$0 (included above)|
|Other (Invitations, save the dates, thank you cards, dress preservation)|0%|$0|3.79%|$1,527|

**Costs not included in the budget above:**

* **Welcome party:** $10,981 Rooftop of a restaurant with a beautiful view. The original quote was $6k but we added an open bar, plus tax and gratuity, so it added up quick. 
* **Our cost to attend the wedding (including flights, airbnb, rental car):** I don’t even want to think about it but probably upwards of $4k. I flew in 3 weeks before the wedding to get shit done and stayed with a friend, he flew in a week before the wedding which is when we got the Airbnb. 
* **Rings**: Engagement ring \~$10K, lab grown diamond. Bands $200 for hers, $600 for his. 
* **Engagement party:** Casual engagement party at our apartment for local friends. \~$600, mostly food and alcohol. 
* **Bachelorette**: \~$2.5k. 4 days in New Orleans. (Note: it didn’t cost $2.5k per person - 2 of the original attendees weren’t able to attend so I covered their share of the Airbnb instead of making them pay/adding the cost to the rest of the group. It was also completely voluntary.)
* **Bachelor party**: He didn’t track how much but he stayed local - steakhouse lunch followed by bar/club hopping. \~$500?
* **Honeymoon**: Hasn’t happened yet but it’s looking like \~$10k. 2 weeks in Greece.

# 5. Cut the fat:

I think a lot of the wedding advice on budgeting is pretty silly. It’s things like “don’t do a champagne toast” that only really save you 1-2% of the budget. 

**Really the only ways to drastically reduce costs for your wedding are:**

1. Aggressively cut your guest list
2. Change the nature of the reception (no dinner, no dancing, no alcohol, etc.)
3. Move the wedding to a lower cost area (destination wedding, rural area, etc.)
4. Get married at a non-peak time (off-season in particular, doing it on a weekday only really changes the venue fee)

Another one that I’ve seen is the suggestion to barter/use your network/DIY. I don’t think this one usually helps that much because it only saves on that individual line item. For example, I could have had my exact wedding at a family member’s backyard, and it only would have saved me $2k, the venue fee. 

That being said, I do want to be transparent about all the little things we didn’t do or didn’t pay for. **Things we didn’t do:**

* **Bathroom boxes**: I have never cared about these at a wedding, club, or anywhere else.
* **Welcome bags:** I have never cared about these at a wedding, and the guests were spread out so it didn’t make practical sense. 
* **Transportation:** Our guests were split between airbnbs and 3+ hotels, and there was plenty of parking and Uber availability, so a shuttle didn’t make any sense. 
* **Professional hair and makeup**: I included a line item for any products I specifically bought to use for the wedding, but I did the hair and makeup myself. I’ve never liked makeup done on me as a bridesmaid and don’t live where the wedding is so there was no opportunity to do a trial before the wedding. 
* **Wedding favors:** Our place cards doubled as wedding favors (we used Mexican tiles and my aunt did calligraphy on paper bands to go around them - $242.20 for 200 tiles on Etsy, and my aunt did it as a wedding gift, but cost for someone to hand letter placecards looks like at least $2/per, so we saved at least $260 worth of labor/materials)
* **Plated dinner:** Due to venue restrictions we had to do a buffet, but this also saved us a lot of money.
* **Videography:** I am so sorry, but I am not a fan of wedding videography these days. The trailer-style highlight reels seem to be all anyone is offering. I would have gladly paid $1-2k for someone to just take video of the ceremony, speeches, and first dance, and just send me those clips, but I couldn’t find anyone. I admittedly didn’t look that hard. My wedding coordinator completely surprised us and shot some “content creator” style clips which were STUNNING. So happy we have those. 
* **Bridal shower**: No need or want. 

**Things we didn’t pay/didn’t pay much for:**

* **DJ:** We have a friend who is a DJ who did it for us, so our only music cost was renting the equipment.
* **DIY flowers**: I paid about $1200 for Costco flowers, $100 for vases on FB marketplace and amazon, and $100 in other materials. A family member’s friend is a retired florist who volunteered to help “project manage” aka make the whole thing possible. We had no idea what we were doing without her. The Costco flowers ended up not being quite enough so we supplemented them from my family member’s garden. I think the flowers we had would have cost at least $5k from a florist, likely more. 6 friends and family volunteered to help create the centerpieces so we made pretty quick work of it once we got started. I can make a whole post about this process and how we did it. I was so lost!!
* **DIY lights**: I got a quote for freestanding poles with bistro lights on them for $6k. I decided it was something we could DIY. It cost about $1k in materials. And a lot of labor from my husband, uncle, and cousin on the two days before the wedding. I could also make a whole post about this. 

**Things we paid too much for:**

* **Save the Dates:** Ok I admittedly loved the result and got lots of compliments, but we DIY’d our letterpress save the dates based on a TikTok and it ended up costing us a LOT of time and money. $428.55 to be exact. 
   * Here is the tutorial: [link](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6Dy6eUc/)
   * I didn’t care about the envelopes (got a sage green set on amazon, like 100 for $20) or stamps and neither did anyone else. 
* **Programs:** I decided to include the seating chart on the back of the program, and I do stand by that decision. I think it’s convenient for guests and s cheaper than a big sign. But I did end up having to print them 4 times. The result? About $400 to print $70 worth of materials. The first time was my fault (forgot a guest and left them off). The second time was also my fault (printed full page sized instead of half-page sized). The third time was not my fault (guests said they weren’t coming anymore so I re-configured the tables). Fourth time was not my fault (guests said “actually no we can come now”). The first two I did through Canva, the third I did through Vistaprint, and the last one I went into Office Depot because they were able to do it same-day. Office Depot ended up being the best price, but it was *slightly* blurry. Worked fine though. 
* **Attire**: 100% worth it to me but also we went way over budget on this. I originally budgeted $4k for my attire. I bought my ceremony dress for $2k from Jenny Yoo (made to order with split sizing, no alterations needed). Then I bought a reception dress from a store called [Brides For A Cause](https://bridesforacause.com/locations/) (please check them out, they have locations in a few west coast cities and are AMAZING!) for $700 + $700 in alterations. Then I bought $1000 worth of jewelry (my logic was that my children might enjoy wearing it, so I should get solid gold and real pearls and (lab grown) stones). Then shoes. Then a getting-ready outfit. $5,115 total for bridal attire and worth every cent to me! My husband spent $2k on his suit and shirts. He was reluctant to get a second shirt for the reception but it was 100% worth it!

**Things we paid a lot for that were 1000% worth it:**

* **Wedding coordinator:** We paid for one coordinator and one assistant. Genuinely would not have been possible without them. If you are in the Seattle area and are looking for one, please consider Everlovely Events, Maria is amazing!
* **Bentwood chairs:** I procrastinated on the chairs and by the time I went to order my original choice, there weren’t enough of them. So we had to upgrade from $4/chair to $8/chair. I didn’t think I cared about the aesthetic of the chairs but I loved the look of these things. 
* **Actual glassware:** The caterer wanted me to use plastic cups and I said no thanks. I rented 500 cups for $500 and then we used plastic cups for the overflow. By the time we got to that point in the night no one cared. 

**Things we paid very little for that were major bang for your buck:**

* [Shawls for when it dropped below 70 degrees](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPFQYYG1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* [Simple monogram cocktail napkins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V8G4RRH?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* [Disposable plates](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKTB6YBQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and [forks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKTB6YBQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) for cake
* [Little lights to put in cocktails after the sun went down ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHRW35WH?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)(BIG HIT!)
* [Light up tinsel wands](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL9XHNKV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (BIG HIT!)
* [Disposable cameras](https://a.co/d/6rSgUf1) (paid $255 for scanning and printing and included that in the photography line item above)
   * Note on these - rather than just putting them on tables, my coordinator reminded me about them when the sun was going down and we passed them out to some young people who I knew would be good at it and have fun. 
   * These were particularly awesome because I got some pics from the wedding nearly immediately, compared to 6-8 weeks for the official photos. 
* [Costco boutonniere and corsage set](https://www.costco.com/boutonnieres-%2526-wrist-corsages%2C-16-count.product.100101172.html)
   * You need to trim and re-tape these day-of, but it’s a pretty simple task that can be delegated. They are so beautiful and an incredible deal. 
* Custom URL. $20 though Zola and so worth it to me. I don’t like QR codes at (for wedding invites and in everyday life). We just did [www.\[bride](http://www.[bride) first name\]and\[groomfirstname\].com because it was available. 

#  6. Notes on Gifts/Registries: 

* While it is smart and polite to include a variety of price points, my experience was that the “nice” stuff got snapped up first. The crystal glasses, nice flatware sets, Le Creuset pieces were purchased first. I think people just want to give a useful but special and memorable gift rather than something that will be used for a couple of years then tossed. I ended up adding more of these more expensive items once most of them had been purchased. Everything left on the registry after the wedding is $40 or less - mostly stuff in the $10-20 range. 
* Big fan of the “group items” - for example, we put a $700 dyson vacuum that 3 people contributed to. I kind of regret not doing a “New couch fund” with like $2k in it. 
* Honeymoon fund - when I created the website we hadn’t decided where we would be going, so I just left it as a generic fund. But I can see how people might have preferred itemized things like “Dinner and X” or “Ziplining in Y.” I did however add a funny tagline that guests told me they liked: “As \[groom\] likes to say, ‘Don’t we have enough stuff?’”
* We used Zola and were really happy with it. Now that we are moving soon we are actually having them hold our items (we run the risk that they go out of stock but I’m okay with that) until after the move. 

**A summary of gifts received** (because I know people are nosey and I like data)**:**

* **Cash/honeymoon fund: $4650**
   * Number of monetary gifts: 20
   * Average: $232.5
* **Value of registry gifts: $6068**
   * Number of gift purchasers: 31
   * Average per purchaser: $196
   * Number of individual gift items: 36
   * Average value of items purchased: $169 (including this point to prove my note above about people tending to buy more expensive items)

# 7. Notes on family help:

As previously mentioned, we didn’t expect any help from our families. But when one of my parents generously offered to pay for the alcohol the week of the wedding, we gladly accepted. Without going into too much detail, we have a complicated relationship. Early in the planning, they wanted to pay for a post-wedding brunch, but I declined. Partially because I didn’t want or need one, partially because I thought it would be more expensive than my parent realized/could afford and I would have to subsidize it, and partially because of a fear that it would later be weaponized/held over my head and I would get stuck paying for it myself despite not wanting it in the first place. We got into an (unrelated) fight mid-wedding planning and I realized my fear was probably correct. 

So general advice on accepting help from parents: I’d only do it if you can (1) accept the strings attached/keep them happy, or (2) afford to take on the costs they are covering if things go south. In the case of the alcohol, we were already planning to pay for it, so if something had happened we were happy to take the cost back on.

My parents are my parents, and they have their issues. I kind of just let them live in the lead up to the wedding despite some crappy behaviour. I thought about setting some boundaries with them in the lead up, but in the end I figured they are going to behave the way they behave and there’s little to nothing for me to do about it, so why stress about it? They ended up behaving pretty well on the wedding day, so that was a pleasant surprise. 

Lastly, extended family members really were there for us in practical ways, particularly with the DIY lights and flowers. I was so touched by this. I think my screwed up nuclear family had made me feel that I don’t have a happy, loving family like so many other brides and grooms have, and the week of the wedding taught me that that isn’t correct at all. I was surrounded by amazing extended family and friends. 

# 8. Miscellaneous wedding planning advice:

* If you get married somewhere with many hotel options, don’t involve yourself in people’s accommodations beyond setting up a courtesy block or two. Your guests are grown ups and can figure it out for themselves. I picked my 3 favorite hotels near the venue and put them in the travel section of my website with descriptions of the hotels (best for kids, has lots of amentities, boutique and cool, etc.) + how far away they are from the welcome party and the wedding venue. That kept it very easy for me and I got a lot of positive feedback on it from guests. 
* Don’t sweat all the little stuff. At some point I just told my coordinator “If I haven’t given an opinion on something by now, I don’t have an opinion on it and I trust your knowledge and instincts.” 
* Keep your dress code simple and don’t sweat what people wear to your wedding. 
   * If someone is dressed inappropriately, that is a reflection of them, not of you or your wedding. 
   * Getting dozens of people to wear a certain color scheme is nearly impossible, and trying to do so is setting yourself up for disappointment. Also, it doesn’t matter if someone wears the same color as the bridesmaids - bridesmaid dresses generally look different from wedding guest dresses and the guests generally know who the bridesmaids are. 
   * Stick to one category (semi-formal, cocktail, formal, or black tie) and trust that the majority of guests will pick a color appropriate for the season. 
* Similar to the above point, in any group of more than a dozen people, there are going to be some who don't read/are not paying attention/are not considerate. That’s just a fact of life. They are going to miss things that are clearly written on your website, they are going to say silly things to you, they are going to RSVP yes, then RSVP no, then RSVP yes again. Just keep it moving. 
* If you are stressing out about a detail, at least make sure it is a meaningful and/or fun detail. We had so many little things that represented our families and heritages, which could be stressful, but the reward was so high that it was worth it. 
* I see so many people complain about how slow RSVPs come in, how many people they have to chase, etc. etc. I had a bit of this experience, but not as much as others. My advice is: keep your RSVP questionnaire as simple as possible. Ours was: \* Are you attending the Welcome Party?  \* Are you attending the Wedding?  \* Do you have any dietary restrictions? 
   * Obviously if you are doing a plated dinner this will be where you will ask what meal they’d like. But if you ask “what songs do you request?” “what hotel are you staying at?” “when do you get in/leave?” people are inevitably going to click into the form, see all the questions, and click back out until they figure it all out. And some will forget and won’t click back in until you chase them. That’s just life. 
   * If you need final numbers 4 weeks before the wedding, make your RSVP deadline no more than 6 weeks before the wedding. I understand wanting the numbers before that but going much sooner than that risks people inaccurately RSVP’ing, and their answers changing later. (Also, don’t send your invitations more than 3-4 months before the wedding. That’s what a Save the Date is for.)
* Lowball your guest count when booking vendors. Most vendors are willing to accept MORE money at a later date, they are not willing to accept LESS money. We told all vendors it would be around 100 guests until we had final numbers and it was 125. No vendors had any problem taking 25% more money from us. 

TLDR: **Build the wedding around the dream budget, not the budget around the dream wedding. Figure out what little stuff you care about the most and don’t stress the rest!**

I’d like our guests to wear certain colors so they’d match with the event more, and I wanted to give them a couple different options to choose from so they didn’t feel too pressured or controlled.  (Maybe something with wiggle room like ‘jewel tones’ ‘pastels’ etc)

The theme is celestial with the colors being various blues and purples, and the venue is industrial with brick walls and a dark ceiling 

My mom will wear navy blue, and my brides maids will probably wear a similar shade of blue. I’m not too sure what my husband-to-be will wear, but it will likely have some sort of dark purple to it. My dress will be ivory or light cream color most likely, I can’t imagine stark white looking that great on me, but maybe I’ll be proven wrong once I actually go dress shopping (according to my timeline/checklist app, dress shopping doesn’t happen until like oct 2026 🤪)

My(23F) best friend, who we'll call R(22F), is getting married later this summer. She and I were friends for a majority of our college years, and I considered us to be very close friends who could always count on one another. R got engaged in 2023, and asked me to be her bridesmaid officially about a year ago. Since then, I have been very supportive of R in whatever way I can. I have helped R create a checklist for wedding planning since she needed help getting organized, I planned R's bachelorette which was later changed to a completely different bachelorette after R and her other bridesmaid K(23F) decided they wanted to change it, I booked all the bachelorette party things and did all the research to try to make it as fun as possible for her, I booked the hotel for the entire wedding party for the night before the wedding, I reached out to potential vendors, I found the bridesmaid dresses for both myself and the other bridesmaid in the color R requested since she was too busy for a proper try-on of the dresses, and so much more. 

  
Some more backstory, for the last few years, R has been having issues with another girl, L(18F) who she used to go to high school with. R claims that L tends to copy her every move and does whatever she can to spite her and one-up her in a way. L recently got engaged to her long time boyfriend and got married not long after, which R claimed was a way of spiting her. Although I could see the tendency to make similar social media posts and whatnot, I never truly thought R was in the right with the whole situation. Even then, I thought R consistently overreacted to some of the things L would do, but I held my tongue and still supported her no matter what and did my very best to be there for her. 

  
Earlier this year, R asked me to be her maid of honor. I happily accepted since I was already doing maid of honor duties like reaching out to venues and coordinating the bachelorette party. More recently, I went through a messy breakup with my own fiancé. He and I were together for over 3 years and it ended in a really traumatic and messy way. I confided in R about this since it was a huge life event that really affected me. At first, I thought it would be difficult to remain in the bridal party, however it was not as difficult as I thought it would be and I didn't let my personal things get in the way of my MOH duties. I chose to remain in the bridal party and stand by my best friend's side. A few days ago was R's bachelorette. During the bachelorette party, I thought we had a lot of fun and I thought we had an amazing time. R said that she was really happy with how it went. Well, today, I got a text message from R stating she no longer wants me in the bridal party at all. She feels as though I need to focus more on healing after my breakup and she doesn't want me to not have fun the day of her wedding since there will be too many responsibilities, so she would rather have me attend as a guest. This completely blindsided me, especially since she had never expressed concern herself regarding my ability to fulfill my bridesmaid duties. To my knowledge, nothing had recently happened between her and I to lead to this, and she had never said otherwise. She wanted to make it clear that she still considers me one of her best friends and she hopes this doesn't affect our relationship. I was completely shocked. 

  
When my fiancé and I broke up, I reached out to R for support. At first she was very supportive, but within a week, she had went right back to venting about L and talking about how stressed she is about the wedding. Even though I was struggling, I listened to her and supported her. I tried to refrain from talking about my breakup as much as possible so I didn't cause R any sort of distress with it. I also did not make my breakup any sort of problem with fulfilling my bridesmaid duties. Although there were some difficult points that made thinking of a wedding very sad for me, I didn't let that get in the way. I understand her kicking me out like this may have been coming from a good place, but I was already her second MOH (she kicked the first one out of the wedding party), I was there for her as often as I could be even when I had my own things going on, I never made my breakup a problem in my wedding planning capabilities, and I feel like if I was truly someone important to her, she would have called me to talk about it and she would have given me that small amount of respect instead of just sending a text message detailing it. It felt very half-hearted and insincere. 

  
Personally, I am in a place right now in my life that is very scary. I just went through a traumatic breakup which caused a lot of changes in my life like my living situation, my financial situation, and my friendships with some people. This just feels like it added so much more pain to that whole thing. I feel very blindsided and betrayed right now when I was already dealing with a bit of a personal crisis. I genuinely care about her, but I feel as though the feeling is not mutual. I don't know if I really want to remain friends with her or attend the wedding as a guest. I feel like it's not something I'm completely comfortable with anymore. However, I think I'm just jumping to some rash conclusions that I don't want to jump to. If you were in my situation, what would you do? Would you attend the wedding as a guest and remain friends with them? Or would you consider this the end?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA35CBA720>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist

I’m 48f, and this is my second marriage, but the first wedding I’ve ever planned (1st wedding was an elopement). 

Having never done this before, I don’t know what I don’t know and have a lot of anxiety building about making sure I’ve got everything covered. 

Reddit, can you please help me figure out a checklist for the big day? Here’s what I’ve got so far:

1. Sent invitations back in September and got about 130ish RSVPs. I think I should still reach out to all my RSVPs about 6-8 weeks prior and make sure they are still planning on coming so I won’t spend money on food no one will eat. Is that a good plan?

2. Venue is chosen and paid for. Venue provides tables and chairs for the ceremony and reception, alcohol service, and a prep kitchen for my caterer.

3. Day-of wedding coordinator is chosen and paid for - I am meeting with her on 5/14 to pre- pre- plan and another meeting on 7/1 to finalize plans. My understanding is she will set up, keep the day on schedule, and be the point of contact for all my vendors and anything that comes up. 

4. Dress and veil are chosen and first fitting has happened. Second fitting on 6/28 - hoping nothing additional will need to happen on the dress. 

5. Shoes - a special pair of dance shoes are on order and should arrive any day now. 

6. Hair and makeup - I want to do myself, still need more practice since I don’t do much makeup normally. I’ve got tailbone length fine hair - planning a simple half-up with some wavy curls for body, considering some clip-in extensions for more volume and body, but haven’t shopped for that yet. 

7. Florist chosen and paid half so far - corsages and boutonnières for immediate family, my bouquet, and flower crowns for myself and two flower girls. There is no official wedding party - just immediate family I’m asking to dress in coordinating color palette (paint swatches sent to them so they can coordinate). Centerpieces for tables are going to be greenery + a few flower buds in small/shallow glass dishes/bowls. I need to shop for the dishes (thinking second hand stores have lots of pretty glass candy dishes that will work).

8. Wedding photographer chosen and almost fully paid for. 

9. Wedding videographer chosen and paid half so far. 

10. Wedding DJ chosen and paid for. 

11. Caterer chosen and paid half so far - need to finalize number of guests 1 month prior to event for final invoice. 

12. Cake person chosen and paid for. 

13. Need linens - table cloths for tables. 

14. My mom said she will help me with tulle bows for the pews in the chapel - need to set date/time to do this together. 

15. Dance choreography and lessons paid for and underway for our first dance. 

16. I’m thinking of singing a song for my husband during the reception… I picked “I do” by Jessie James Decker. Need to learn it/practice it. I’m a talented singer, so this will not be an embarrassment to myself, lol. 

17. Officiant chosen and planning on it (free). 

18. Need to choose 2 people to do speeches?? One from my side and one from groom’s side?

19. How will I go down the aisle? I have a father and stepfather. I love both. I’m not a kid so no one is “giving me away,” per se. my father is not in robust health and walking beside me might be difficult for him. Both would be offended no matter who walks me, or if I split it between both of them (offended about who went first vs last), and the aisle isn’t wide enough for one on each side of me. I’m actually thinking more and more that no one will walk me down the aisle, haha! Also, there won’t be father-daughter dance or groom-mother dance (groom’s mother is deceased). 

20. We’ve decided on a “first look” but other than that, no actual sequence of the day has been figured out yet. 

What else have I not mentioned? I’m getting quite anxious I will forget something critical and mess up our otherwise wonderful day.

We've been so lucky to have some financial backing from both of our parents and budgeting was going well, with us thinking we only had to contribute about 3k each out of our own pockets to make everything work. Our first problem happened when we had a meeting with our caterer and they'd begrudgingly had to tell us that they forgot to add the cost of our late night snack and the cost of staffing to our invoice. They felt horrible about the situation and added three extra free appetizers to our cocktail hr to make up for it which kinda helped with the shock. The second is a 15% landmark fee. We only just noticed/ it was made apparent after we were sent a vendor's checklist from our venue after finalizing everything. 

I fully understand weddings are expensive and post covid did not help the price of anything but now we're both looking at a contributing an extra 10,000 each just to make it happen and it's becoming a little much. The extra cost of things is essentially what I have in my savings, so now I have to really budget the months leading up to the wedding in order to have enough saved to cover things and not completely drain my bank account.

I guess I'm just bummed about how much it's all becoming and the wedding is really starting to stress me out rather than excite me.

1) My fiance's dad makes amazing pasta sauce and we dreamed of including it in the wedding, but we were pretty sure a caterer wouldn't let us provide part of the meal like that for liability reasons. But they said it was fine! We're so relieved and excited.

2) Just picked up my dress from the seamstress and it's perfect and also only cost $110 for alterations! I had budgeted $500 and worried that was not going to be enough. Another huge relief!

3) We're providing lodging for the wedding party, and gave people a few different options (shared rooms or not, basically) -- and our friends universally picked the cheapest option! Even though we didn't share prices etc as we didn't want to pressure them. *Another* relief!

Our venue required us to get a partial planner, so we booked one after interviewing a few. I'm honestly so confused at what she's supposed to even be doing. We're 5 months out now, shouldn't she be doing more?

I thought she was supposed to review our contracts, but she's so damn slow to respond I don't even know if she'd review the damn things in time. We just ended up doing a lot on our own...so what are we spending $6k on, a glorified day of coordinator?

Example: We wanted DJ recommendations. Took weeks to get any, and I had to CC her boss to get a response, and then she apologized for missing my emails. Whatever, I can excuse it a bit... but then on feb 26th we had a planning meeting where she said she would give us our timeline in 2 weeks. It'll be 5 weeks tomorrow! I emailed her, and I'll give it a day or so then I'll probably have to CC her boss *again.* Ugh, I hate this, I don't like being confrontational but I literally do not understand what we are paying for. If we weren't this late in the game I'd ask our planner company if we can fire her and get someone else.

We just selected our linens this Saturday, and the rental place asked if we want to put it under our caterer or the planner. I said caterer...but she said that <planner> is usually more responsive. I didn't say anything, but I wanted to say that we had the complete opposite experience...

  
Edit: Thanks for everyone that said to look at the contract, here it is:

● Creating a wedding planning checklist - we got this early

● Three one hour Pre-Wedding Consultations - had 1

● Limited phone calls/emails - VERY slow as stated

● Constructing a detailed wedding day timeline - supposed to receive 3 weeks ago

● Supplying any needed vendor referrals - very slow to this, but did provide

● Review of vendor contracts - did not

● Venue Site Walk - has not done yet

● Designing a venue layout - I guess this is still happening? 

● Confirming all details with the appropriate vendors prior to the wedding - I hope??

● Facilitating the ceremony rehearsal - not yet

I saw a TikTok where someone said your wedding needs to be formal enough to justify formal /black tie optional and above attire. To me, that totally makes sense! You don’t want guests to be dressed in tuxes for a barn wedding. 

But what else makes a wedding formal? What would a formal wedding have that justifies the dress code for you?


For background I’m having a wedding in the backyard of a very very nice house. All the men in bridal party will be in tuxes and bridesmaid / mothers in gowns. But since it’s a house affair I want to make sure to add formality in other ways. 

Edit:

Adding details since I guess formality can be measured by fitting a checklist

* venue is a modern style large house with a pool in the backyard and on the water 
* <100 guests
* valet parking
* begins at 4pm
* cocktail hour has 8 passed apps and a string quartet
* dinner is plated with table side service for side dishes
* live band during dinner and until 9:30
* dj from 9:30 onwards
* coffee cart and passed apps at 10pm 
* ceremony will be on grass
* liquor we’ll buy from Costco tbh and I don’t really even know what top shelf liquor is. None of our guests except maybe a couple of FIL’s friends are major drinkers. We’ll just get whatever our parents decide is best when we hit up Costco the week of.

* Finish making my DIY stained glass welcome sign
* Pay for catering
* Order our cake and dessert for guests (We're doing cookie cake and cookies/brownies for everyone else so it isn't as time-consuming or costly as a wedding cake)

* Print out all the checklists & schedules for the wedding party
* Purchase everything for the emergency kit
* Finish writing vows (I've started like 1000 times, I know what I want to say it's just hard to put it all together. And I'm diagnosed OCD with a Bachelor's in English so they have to be perfect)
* Write our parents their notes. We decided to forego gifts for our parents because nothing felt special enough. We are writing them notes and possibly framing them with space to include pictures after we get them back.
* Finish collecting pictures of deceased loved ones for the memorial table so I can print them. (Hate that I had to delegate this one) I also need to decide on the quote I'm using for this table, so that sign isn't printed yet. 
* Get frames for \^ these pictures, this is dependent on how many pictures we end up with. I'm hesitant to include one person.
* Purchase board/card games for kids entertainment.
* Purchase the drink ""cooler"" for the reception (Vintage bathtub at my local antique shop)
* Purchase all liquor and finger food for cocktail hour (We aren't using a bartender)

My fiancé and I hired a planner for partial planning and design in June 2024 for our October 2025 wedding. She came highly recommended by vendors and was extremely well reviewed, but at 9 months out she is causing me nothing but stress. I’d love to get unbiased opinions on if I should fire her or if I’m overreacting. 

Upon hiring her, she sent me a list of recommended vendors, a monthly planning checklist, and gave me a very rough outline of when we’d be meeting. We had an initial 1.5 hour call in August to discuss big picture items and met in person for a few hours in October to do a venue walkthrough (at my request) and view a couple rental showrooms. She told me she’d get quotes for the rentals I liked to me by the following week, which is where things really fell off…

I followed up with her 3 weeks after our in person meeting asking if she had gotten the quotes and when we should meet again. It took another 2 weeks of me sending follow up emails and a text before she finally sent me the quotes (with zero guidance on next steps) and asked for my availability to schedule a call with a florist. I’ve sent her my availability on two separate occasions with no response and haven’t heard a peep from her since mid-December. 

I’m trying to be gracious since some of this communication took place over the holiday season, but completely ignoring me for weeks without so much as an acknowledgment that she received my email or she’s working on something feels unacceptable. I hired her because I work a very demanding full time job and can admittedly become easily overwhelmed, but so far she’s caused me significantly more stress than she’s eased. 

I know we are due to have a difficult conversation regardless of whether we part ways or continue working together, but I don’t even know if it’s worth giving her an opportunity to redeem herself at this point. I feel like I’d be better off just planning this all myself and getting a month or day of coordinator. I’d lose out on about an $1800 deposit unless she is agreeable to a partial refund for limited services rendered thus far. Any thoughts or suggestions?

The problem is most coordinators include things I don't need/have already completed like vendor booking, binder creation, checklists, layout planning etc etc. this leads to increased pricing that I unfortunately don't have the budget for.

I had a beautiful wedding day but my day of coordinator was horrible. How should I handle this based on the following scenario?

For starters she asked me zero questions regarding the decor until the night before at the rehearsal. She had assured me the rehearsal was plenty of time to go over everything. When I seen that it wasn’t I sent her a text at 6 am the morning of my wedding to say where I wanted everything. She finally created a checklist.

She lost pictures that were vital to my decor. My husband did find them at the end of the night. 

She was extremely forgetful she would ask me if everything was ok occasionally throughout the night decor wise and I would tell her one thing & it never got done.

She asked me and my husband a lot of questions throughout the wedding that should have been answered previously. Even down to the timeline.

She told the dj to announce things in the wrong order according to him. At one point I got up from the sweetheart table to correct the dj. 

I asked her if she could see if my mil was ready to do a speech and she forgot. My mil also forgot so it just never happened. 

Lastly, she left us to pack up everything on our own. In the initial conversation she stated all the decor is the be packed up in the car at end of night. The contract states complete set up & pack up (because the “pack into car” language is not in the language she stated it wasn’t in the contract.) 

On our wedding night she had a childcare issue so she watched as me, my husband, and family packed up everything. From her car with her 2 year old and 6 month old. 

I did call her and address the big points and originally she agreed to give me a 50% refund. Later that evening she changed her mind and sent a list of all the Extra things she did like taking out the trash, cleaning buffet table, sweeping, doing the rehearsal and helping write my vows. All things she strongly insisted on doing after seeing me do them. 

At this point I have not responded to her text, and I don’t think I’m going to respond to her directly. I believe I will however address certain things in the review. What would you do?

The wedding was perfect and amazing, and we ran almost completely on schedule. What mishaps happened a wedding coordinator wouldn’t have been able to fix or prevent. 

I will say I was organized and had timeline and checklists printed for everyone in personalized binders. It made it perfect so no one ever had to ask me a question on the day of — to the point that my friend group now has “it’s in the binder” as an inside joke. 

I will also mention we had a ton of small details, so it wasn’t a simple wedding that we happened to get lucky on. The hotel was 15 minutes down a gravel road, and all our ceremony items were used in detail shots, our guestbook was a metal stamping station where everyone had to learn how to stamp metal, we included our dogs, had a temporary tattoo station, board games, etc. 

Tearing down the night of wasn’t awful either, we made sure it was social event and had gifts of appreciation for everyone, and honestly I was so wired I wasn’t even tired when we were packing up. We did label and number all boxes and that was super helpful for both setup and tear down. 

Also, in case anyone is also considering this, we did hire a tattoo artist for the after party the next day and it was so worth it. I am so thankful we didn’t try to book her for the actual reception, there is legitimately no way she would’ve had time to get everyone done and even then she also said she would get a second artist if she were to do it again because it’s just a lot for one person (she did have an assistant to help clean up).

I'm new to this specific subreddit as I just got engaged 5 days ago! (yay me!) I'm a chronic over-thinker and I've already gotten myself overwhelmed with all of the decisions that need to be made and the money that will need to be saved. 

For context; my fiancé (that's so weird to say!) is hoping to get into a 2 year program in the fall of 2025. He's applied and he's just waiting to hear back, but I don't doubt that he'll get in. Once the program starts, he'll be super busy with classes every spring, summer, fall, and winter semesters until the program is done. So, we either have to get married before he starts his program, or wait until he's done in the fall of 2027. Also, when he is in the program he will have to cut back on hours at work so that means less money coming in and, frankly, the idea of working, going to school full time, and planning a wedding sounds like a waking nightmare. so, needless to say, we're looking at late summer 2025. So I have, roughly, 10 months to pull this shiz together.

I sat down to try to make a checklist of things that we make sure we talk about and what needs to be done by what time, and it's... A lot. Let me just give you a look at my internal dialogue. Just imagine a woman hunched over in a corner of a dark room, rocking back and forth, mumbling all of this to herself and you'll get the (very frightening, gollum-esque) picture.

*""We've decided on an elopement, so... pick the location, check the laws at the location. Do you need 2 witnesses and an officiant? Do we need to have an officiant from that state? Or can we ask someone we already know? Crap, I need to remember to look into that later. Book a photographer, do we want a videographer? Decide if you want to bring close family and friends along. Dammit, I know that if we were going to bring some of our family along that not everybody we want there will be able to afford to buy plane tickets, pay for their own lodging, and take the time off of work all at once so we'll need to set money aside for that as well. We're going to have to put together a budget as soon as possible. I also need to decide on a dress, shoes, hair, makeup, suit, tie, flowers..? Do we even want flowers? F\*ck this, I'll just hire a planner. But.. there's no way I can afford to hire a planner, photographer, buy plane tickets, lodging, a dress, wedding bands, flowers...""*

You get the idea. The doom-spiral is real.

So, I guess what I'm asking is; What did you find unnecessary or a waste of money/effort when you eloped? What made your planning process easier? And, if you're a professional in the biz or have been a part of a lot of weddings, what is a very common mistake you see time and time again? I don't have anybody in my life that has decided to elope, so I'm turning to you guys to see if you have any good advice to give!

We are getting married at a slightly non-traditional venue, but one that does enough events and weddings that they have a whole wedding info section on their website. We are required to use their on-site small businesses for food and alcohol, which is fine and was actually part of the appeal. We had no problems signing the contract for the venue but ever since then things have been *awful*! We get no response, or we get wrong information, or we get asked questions that we have already answered. The most recent back-and-forth about catering has been several iterations of 'my name is misspelled on the contract. Now my name is right but the amount is wrong. Now the amount is right but the date is wrong.' etc. 

And it has been like this with *everyone*! HMUA has my signed contract but I have been hounding them for 2 weeks about how to pay the deposit. Transportation company sent a completely reasonable looking quote, but instead of a contract or web form they just sent a blank pdf credit card authorization form to hold the date. Our photographer promised a 2 week turnaround for E-photos but took 4 weeks. We have 'full service' planners who just send us a generic checklist every month. I would be out of a job if I was this bad at overpromising and underdelivering but it seems to be the standard with all of these vendors. It's maddening!

Please, someone tell me all of this time and mental load and money and stress are worth it. I am still excited about having our families and friends gathered together in one place to celebrate.

I am so happy to be with the man I love but dang I need to vent about my horrible planner/coordinator. 

I’ve been trying really hard to let go of the anger and resentment I have towards her, but I need to let it out 

First she forgot my extremely simple welcome sign. I’m still wondering where that was. 

The way she acted on the wedding day was disappointing and panic enducing. She told me she would come get my girls before the ceremony and she didn’t. And they had to walk in the processional even through they were supposed to be seated prior (I had no actual bridal party, they just got ready with me). She didn’t even tell me the ceremony was starting and I was sitting up in the bridal suite waiting for a que and I just came down my self and barely made it on time. I felt so scattered walking down the aisle because of the lack of direction. She didn’t fluff my dress or teach my friend to do it like she said she would.

After the ceremony she said she would stay with me and bustle my dress. I had no idea where she went and she took my phone. I didn’t know the plan was to fix my dress at grooms cottage because she never told me, just abandoned my groom and I.

She never brought us apps until we had to ask multiple times. 6p came and went and we had to beg her to do our grand entrance. We were anxiously waiting for her, ya know since it was a big moment for us. Someone else ended up queuing the Dj for us. 

She didn’t que us for a single timeline event before we had to remind her. People were eating cake before the cutting and I ended up just coordinating the cutting with the dj myself. The rest of the night I just coordinated straight with the dj. 

The flowers were beautiful, but she almost ruined them by leaving them out of water in boxes overnight. I’m not sure if she treats every couple like this or just us, but I was extremely disappointed with her as my wedding coordinator. She never apologized and came off really defensive when I asked for help. 

Also apparently she didn’t sleep the night before, and had a sobbing meltdown while getting my reception area ready for unknown reasons.

I promise I’m a very chill bride, only had 75 guests. I hired pretty much all the vendors myself. The Dj told me she was the worst coordinator he had ever seen. 

Working with her leading up to the event was also horrible. So many unanswered questions. She had no outline or checklist or anything. Working with her was like a cloud of confusion and I’m just so happy it’s over. So many things she promised leading up to the event didn’t end up happening.

EDIT TO ADD: she is a family friend of my now sister and law. She was all buddy buddy at first and made it seem like everything would be great.

Anyone have any idea of anything I should add to let them know? Do you think that covers it?

Pictures are important to me but I’m wondering if its worth cutting out giving the girls matching pajamas/robes. Honestly we’re around 20k over budget and want to focus money left to spend on important things. Did you find it kind of necessary for you that the bridesmaids/groomswomen wore matching robes for bridal suite pictures? I will get them but also don’t have the time or bandwidth to waste on something that may not be worth it.

Here's my desperate plea to the universe to either quell my anxiety or agree with my hunch.

My fiancé \[28\] and I \[28\] are getting married this September. He was born and raised in central Italy and we are marrying there. We are frequently in and out of Italy with the exception of this year due to career promotions here in the US. We talked/met with a handful of local planners prior to hiring our current, ""Anna"", who was recommended by the venue (we booked our venue a year prior to meeting her, and Anna, 15 months priors to the wedding). Her reviews were stellar, and her team looked good. We were in Italy at the end of August (essentially one year out), for catering tastings. Initially, we were impressed with her and how quickly she booked appointments and corresponded.

However, as soon as we left, the conversation died. After inquiring, Anna explained her she wasn't available to discuss our wedding until mid-October due to her busy schedule closing the wedding season —*a reasonable explanation*, I thought. Yet, despite assurances of being ""fully at our disposal"" thereafter, I found myself aggressively initiating all of the conversation. I wanted to be ready for her when she finished, so I sent her a detailed analysis of our catering appointments, multiple *detailed* inspiration emails for lighting, ceremony, florals, rentals, etc. I laid everything out, so I was expecting it would be a layup to book vendors. Also, our temporary contracts with caterers were expiring end of October, so I was eager to finalize this quickly to reserve our spot.

October ended, and we panicked because she told us not to worry about the caterer. Even without a contract, the caterer we liked is ""holding our spot"". This made me nervous. November came and went, and we ended up booking our own photographer, as who she had worked with prior didn't align with us (ex: American/International photographers, or photographers who were way out of budget). In December, I continued aggressively communicating with her about booking vendors, getting proposals, booking a rehearsal dinner location, receiving virtually minimal responses. I called her and explained I was getting anxious, and felt we were falling behind. She reassured me, apologized, and told me everything will be booked by the end of January - ""\[she's\] on it"". January comes, and I'm messaging her to ensure she's on schedule to follow through with her promise. I'm hearing every excuse in the book (some true), and very little is getting done - a few messages here and there, two rehearsal dinner venue visits, but with no follow up. At this point, we ended up booking our videographer independently due to delays and dissatisfaction with her suggestions.

I called her again, telling her she didn’t deliver anything on her deadline. She responded, emotionally and “honestly”, telling me she “didn’t have the energy to focus on our wedding for 2 months due to a family emergency”. The details were convincing, and I sympathized, but I told her I was very concerned about the wedding. She promised to kick it into high gear moving forward. At this point, given my career alignment and deep experience with planning, I did the unthinkable - I made a 104pg document detailing everything about the wedding - A to Z - start to finish, with clear instructions, checklists, etc. I left no stone unturned. It was the entire wedding, planned. It took me *endless, endless hours* to complete, and I sent it to her, asking her to simply execute. I was starting to feel desperate and needed to regain control - either way, this wedding is happening in 7 months, and I don't want it to be ruined. She called me and we joked about how “I’m crazy” - “Please don’t worry, everything is under control”. I told her I don’t feel that way and she again, “reassured me”. She admitted that she *just* read all of my email communications from Nov/Dec, and that again, ""she's on it"".  I just texted her this morning, asking for any updates, as we’re two weeks into February, and we have received one floral proposal (who we declined) and two RD proposals. Still - nothing booked, except our P/V, not even the final catering contract, and we’re 7 months away. This is causing me extreme stress, and I’m tired of feeling this way, on top of all of my other priorities. 

I need to know - am I crazy? Should we fire her? Any advice? I feel like vomiting. ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36F80110>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist

After I explained the issue with the hotels, and how we would have to hire multiple shuttles for multiple trips starting at noon and ending at 11, and that we’d have to confirm with each guest where they are staying and if they would even use the shuttle. I thought my head was going to explode.
And then they insisted that I need to provide guests with the local shuttle companies information so they can hire them.
10 minutes later, and they still didn’t believe me when I said ‘that’s not how things work for an event shuttle service’ and guests would be far better off hiring an Uber. 

Then something was said about my brother, wife, and 2 year old daughter(flower girl) not having a car. 

Now I don’t know how accurate this is, that they have no intention of renting a car. 

I am more than happy to provide transportation for my bridal party and their families the day of the wedding. Honestly, it just makes sense to keep things running smoothly.

But am I responsible for picking up all 3 of my brothers and their families from the airport within 48 hours of my wedding?
 
And what about the rehearsal and the dinner? 

Again, I’m the last to get married, and I know every one of us at some point rented a car for at least one of my brothers weddings.

After this conversation had just sucked the life out of me, I called my FH who was driving home from something and was going to be an hour drive.

When I told him all of this, he told me he loved me and was calling my father to speak to him man to man..

When he got home he told me that he was very clear that yes, we will take care of our bridal party, within realistic expectations. It is not technically our responsibility to arrange transportation for every aspect of their trip.

And that guests will be responsible for their own transportation. 

I feel like I’ve gone crazy. Like there’s this huge logistical nightmare I’m expected to sort out as part of my wedding planning, and after a year of research, Reddit posts, reviewing others brides checklists, I somehow managed to completely overlook this expectation.

So am I a crazy bridezilla for thinking this is a completely unrealistic expectation?",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA36F80410>,self.weddingplanning,wedding checklist

Well, I’m still in the registry creation phase, but I hate it. It doesn’t automatically group items, and the only way to reorder the list is to drag and drop. When you have a big list, that’s a lot of dragging, and it’s glitchy as hell. Group gifting is only available for gifts over $350 (why?). *I asked WithJoy about this, and got a response saying they don’t offer group gifting at all… then how was I able to click the “group gifting” button for my KitchenAid?? 😅*

They have a “registry advisor” that is supposed to help you make sure you have a balanced registry in terms of the cost of items.. It doesn’t work. Registry advisor says we have 178 things on our registry. At the moment we have 72. *WithJoy clarified that 72 is the number of unique items requested, 178 is the number of items including multiples. Why is this not explained anywhere on the site? Idk*

They have a “checklist” that is supposed to help you make sure that you have everything on your list. It doesn’t work. Tons of stuff on the checklist is on our list, but it says we still need to add it.

The sync, transfer, link choice they give you is super confusing. I still don’t understand what it means, except that my Anthro registry is relegated to a small link at the very bottom of the registry. I’m sure no one will even see it down there.

I was tolerating all of the glitches until I noticed that there was no logical order to the registry items and no feasible way to fix that. Now I am annoyed. 

The website design and rsvp features aren’t much better. Clunky and difficult to use. So annoying and such a waste of time.

Our  wedding is in 10 more days and we have been thinking about letting  our day of coordinator go.. I met with her a few months ago and she  seemed nice and professional and claims that she's been doing event  planning for 30 years. She seemed legit because she has a LinkedIn,  company website, has 4-5 star reviews on weddingwire.com (only 15 total  reviews though).  The reason I've been considering letting her go is  because I feel like she hasn't fulfilled some of the terms of our  contract. She claims that we can call her or ask her questions unlimited  times, but she takes a long time to respond. It's happened a few times  where I asked her a question and she didn't respond for a while, if at  all. For example, I asked her a while ago about her opinion regarding  shuttle versus Uber events. I didn't hear a response from her in over a  week. I ended up figuring out what to do on my own and I let her know  that. She then responds the next day saying her was happy that I figured  out the transportation. 🙄 another time I asked her if she could review  the shuttle timeline I created and she never even responded to my  question. She acted like I never asked it.. more recently, I asked if  she wanted a list of my vendors and their phone numbers in case anything  arises the day of the wedding and she needs to contact them. I haven't  heard anything from her in 5 days and our wedding is in less than 2  weeks..

It's just frustrating and  disappointing to me because I felt like she promised me all these things  and made it sound like she was going to be helpful for the wedding. I  even asked her if she was going to help me create a wedding timeline and  she said she would. It is even listed in her contract that she will  help me with a wedding timeline and she has not even reached out to me  once about creating one. I ended up spending 3 hours creating a wedding  timeline myself because I feel like I can't trust her to make one with  only so many days left.. her contract even stated that she will help me  create detailed checklists and contact sheets. She hasn't reached out to  me once to do any of these pre-planning tasks that's listed in the contract. I ended up creating both of these myself.

I  did ask her if she will help set up all the wedding decor and she said  she would. She didn't even ask me any questions regarding how I want it  to be decorated, nothing. She just said to make sure I leave the  decorations there the day before when we go to the dress rehearsal. I  ended up finding out that my fiance and I can come early the day before  the wedding to set up the wedding decor, so I think we are just going to  do that ourselves because at this point I don't even know if I can  trust her with that.

In the  contract it says we are supposed to pay the remaining balance 3 days  before the wedding ($400).  I feel hesitant doing that based on how  she's been so far. I honestly don't even know what she will do to help  the day of the wedding that would be worth $900? I would rather just  give her the $500 we already gave her months ago. I even looked on the  wedding wire.com where she lists her company - she lowered her services  to $750 instead of $900??  

I'm thinking of waiting until 3 days before the wedding (when her remaining balance is due) because I'm sure she will finally reach out to me then asking for her final payment.  My fiance and I are going to have a discussion with her stating that she has not met some of the terms in her contract in regards to the pre-planning terms. We are going to try and get her to lower her cost of services to $500 instead, if not, $750 (the amount she has listed on her website).  If she is not willing to do either, my fiance wants to take her to small claims court to get our $500 deposit back from her and let her go as our DOC.

For context, we met long distance and moved together to a new city last year. We live in a HCOL area and are in the process of applying for a mortgage, making a tough decision between two states to settle down in permanently (have to be out of our rental by this fall.) I recently started a new, big job, and separately, am about to put my former home on the market and will need to travel for both. This is all wonderful change but like….yikes. That’s how you wind up on Reddit at 3am.

I have experience in large events, project mgmt and art design so I’m looking forward to planning a wedding, but struggling to untangle what’s most important to focus on right now.

- Wedding doesn’t have to be where we live. We’ve ruled out eloping or anything international, however even if we choose one of our birthplaces it’ll be a destination wedding for more than half the guests. Is it silly to hire a planner to help source venue availability before we pick a city? Do planners tend to only know their market vs cross-country? I could also see the opposite scenario where availability helps determine which city we choose. Wondering if I should blast out a bunch of emails to venues myself and narrow it down, which will take time to research. Vaguely thinking about 100 people, flexible on type of space which should help.

- Does Sept/Oct 2024 make sense as a target date? We really don’t want to wait to 2025 and would avoid the holidays.

- I’ve seen every checklist, app and vendor template but am leery to start building in one and discover it’s not robust or buggy or something. Would love any advice on the go-to if you only chose one to get organized.

My fiance and I are planning on doing a destination wedding and had settled on a resort in the Domnican Republic. We used a travel agent to select a hotel (haven't booked yet) and got in touch with their wedding coordinator. We chose a wedding package and put down the deposit and everything was fine. We got an email with the budget planner and checklist and we were in awe at how expensive the add-ons were. No DJ or sound equipment at the reception, the photographer only takes photos at the ceremony, no dance floor, very minimal decorations for the ceremony and reception, etc. All said and done it looks like it would cost between $12-$15k (about double what I thought it would be) for 35 people excluding travel and resort fees.

I think we got a little ahead of ourselves and didn't do enough research. We are very anxious with the idea of paying all of this money to not be able to see it in person and for it to end up sucking. We aren't averse to the idea of paying over budget but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of value in spending so much for so few people.

 I just wanted to see if anyone else has had any experience with resort weddings in Mexico or the DR. Did you have to pay for a lot of add-ons? Did the experience meet your expectations? How was working with the wedding coordinators?

We have plenty of time to cancel and get back our deposit but wanted to see if we didn't choose the right resort or if this is something that isn't within our budget range. Thanks",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA32C745F0>,self.Weddingsunder10k,wedding checklist

We just finalized the last wedding bill (feels so good 😄), and we’ve been reflecting on how smoothly everything ran. A big part of what helped us stay organized was the planner spreadsheet I built to manage the budget, guest list, timeline, and all the moving parts. After the wedding, I went back and updated the planner with everything I learned — so I’m happy to share it here with anyone else preparing for their big day!

I recently planned my own wedding — we had about 40 guests, kept it under €5,000, and hosted it outdoors. As we already done the registration before, this wedding is more like a wedding party. To stay organized (and avoid losing our mind), I built a spreadsheet to track everything: budget, Invitation list, timelines, etc.

It really helped me stay focused and not overspend, so I wanted to share it here in case it helps anyone else planning a wedding on a budget!

Here’s the free template: 

What’s inside:
	•	Budget tracker (with automatic totals)
	•	Invitation list
	•	Preparation to-do checklist
	•	Wedding day timeline

I’d really love to hear your feedback — whether it’s helpful, missing something, or if anything could be improved. I’m planning to keep refining it based on what real couples actually need.

Wishing you all happy planning and beautiful celebrations!

My partner and I live far away from most friends and family (military life) so getting them to DIY things isn’t really an option bc they’re all flying in to attend to the wedding. 🫠🫠  I have a lot of questions!!

1. How do you set a budget? 
2. When do you send out save the dates/invites? Our engagement is ~6 months long. 
3. Are all-inclusive venues or “bring your own” venues cheaper? (~75 people invited)
4. What order should we buy/book things? 
5. Should we reserve a hotel block? 
6. Are there any 6 month engagement timelines/checklists out there? 

FYI: Wedding would be in the continental US!

Budget: none 
Advice: priceless",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA34BD7020>,self.Weddingsunder10k,wedding checklist

Last night we decided we'd really like to get married this June.  Today checked and our ceremony site is open 3 Saturdays in June, our venue is available 2 of those Saturdays.  I'm just waiting to see if the caterer is free one of those two days.  I've already (today) designed digital save the dates and we have our invite list together.  I felt like if I can get those three signed and the save the dates out the door, I'd be in pretty good shape...

But I chose to look up some wedding checklists and now I'm nervous.  I'm not feeling picky about photographer... Ditto on DJ.  How far in advance does that really need to be?  I'm ordering pie from Village in so no cake problems.  His dad is a minister and will do that.  How far in advance do you need to order flowers from Costco, there's no way that's 12 months out right?  The online store that was selling my dream dress has gone out of business, so I have to start from square one there, how far in advance do you need to order from most places?  In what order should I prioritize the things I'm missing?

TLDR: 6 months out should I be freaked out I don't have a photographer, DJ, Costco flowers or dress?  Online lists are telling me I should have had these done.

We got engaged on 12/31/2021 and in January decided we wanted to get married this fall. We settled on mid-October. When we picked the date we were still about 10 months out and that seemed totally reasonable to plan a wedding. However, with March rapidly approaching and nothing set in stone other than the date and a church (and really, if we wanted to change those, we probably still could) I'm looking for some advice on how to handle planning and organization, which will hopefully really get the ball rolling.

Now, I am an organized person and am good at managing lots of different types of information (e.g. I have handled many aspects of planning large family reunions in the past). However, I have never planned a wedding before. I would love to know what systems you all use.

I downloaded the free APW ""Every Wedding Checklist"" and have taken a look at the six-month planning guide there. Right now, I'm just making lists in a regular notebook. I will be visiting my mom soon and with her help hope to delegate some tasks, as well as hone in on some real possibilities in terms of reception venues, catering, etc., then.

I’m realizing that one of my top priorities is finding any date in August/Sept of 2021 that a decent venue is available; I’ll take a damn Wednesday at this point. Then it’s inviting close family and a few friends to start (like 20-30 people), and if we’re all able to get a vaccine by this time we can add on a few local friends as well. Why not ya know? Everything else we’re just winging too.

Although we’ve been talking about weddings for a while I didn’t think my fiancé was going to be so chill/understanding/on the same page as me on so many things. I’ve pretty much excommunicated a lot of family members so we knew my end of the guest count would be small, and although his extended family is a lot closer, he doesn’t see the point in spending a ton of money on a big venue and hosting out of state guests that he see’s once every 2 years. Plus we both don’t like the spotlight. I’ll also show him a place and he’s like “I like it let’s do it there” and then he’ll say the same thing about a different venue 5 minutes later ~ definitely a go with the flow kind of dude.

I think we really only care about being married, but we still want to look back on this photos like “That was a pretty nice day ya know”.

I posted this to /r/weddingplanning, but I wanted to share here as well. This sub helped give me ideas and moved some of the wedding planning process along. 

First, pictures! I tried to narrow them down - we got about 340 pics from our photographer. I picked the most relevant snapshots to this post so you guys could see a little bit of each element that went into play.  

[https://imgur.com/a/A9FRA1h](https://imgur.com/a/A9FRA1h)

***Overview***

Engaged February 14, 2018. Married Saturday, September 1, 2018. 4pm ceremony with a 5pm dinner immediately after. My husband and I decided from the start that we wanted to keep the day simple and laid back. We focused on what we thought was important, and a lot of traditions were thrown out the window. Many items were DIY. We had eight bridal party members: four groomsmen, two bridesmen (one being man of honor) and two bridesmaids. We had \~35 people between us, our bridal party, and our guests. All who were invited attended (minus a few celebrity invites, ha!). Our guest list was intentionally kept small, as we wanted things to be intimate. A few extended families members had hoped to come, but it would snowballed out of control had we opened things up. I used The Knot for our wedding website, checklist, budget, registry, etc. It helped a great deal in planning everything. 

***Big Items***

* **Ceremony Site $1,350 –** Our venue was the Cary Arts Center in Cary, NC. The ceremony itself was held on the stage, and our reception was held immediately after in one of the large multi-purpose rooms. They provided the tables and chairs. Part of the rental fee included having a stage technician to control lighting and music, and a house manager to help us direct people. We gained access to the venue at 12pm, and our bridal party helped us set up decorations. They also assisted us in cleaning up at the end of everything. We were out of the venue completely by around 8pm. 
* **Photographer $1,900 -** Lotus Creative Studios, Winston-Salem, NC. The cost included six hours of coverage, which was more than enough time, and we paid extra for a second photographer for a total of $1,900. 
* **Catering $1,247.04 -** Backyard Bistro, Raleigh, NC**.** BBQ buffet, and we decided against serving alcohol for several different personal and logistical reasons. Vast majority of the folks we invited don't drink, so it wasn't missed. I ordered enough to feed 45 people, since I wasn't sure how many folks from the theater staff might be eating. We had a lot of food left over to take home. 

***Clothing***

* **Dress $484.33 -** David’s Bridal Strapless Ruched Mermaid Tulle Wedding Dress in Soft White. The size I ordered fit me perfectly once I put heels on, so I ultimately didn’t need any alterations.
* **Veil(s) $65.04 –** I ordered two inexpensive veils from AliExpress. I couldn't decide between two designs and wanted to see how the quality would be in person. I really liked my first choice once it arrived. I chose to wear it for the ceremony only.
* **Dress Extras $81.07 –** Shapewear and crinoline from Amazon, yellow laces for the back of the dress from eBay.
* **Shoes $30.99 –** Yellow Mary Jane style pumps, ordered from Amazon.
* **Reception Dress $30.69 –** Amazon. It was the same dress picked for my bridesmaids; they ordered theirs in yellow and I ordered mine in white. I changed immediately after the ceremony and family pictures were over. 
* **Groom’s Outfit $120 –** Vest, pants, shirt, and tie from Amazon. Already owned matching pair of dress shoes. We sent the same list to the groomsmen so they could order what they needed.
* **Wedding Rings $391.58 –** Husband and I both ordered rings from Etsy. Mine was $318, his was $73.58. White gold and tungsten, respectively. My engagement ring came from Etsy as well.

***Ceremony***

* **Officiant $0 -** Our officiant was the same minister that performed my mother’s wedding ceremony a few years ago, and as a gift did the ceremony without charging us.
* **Flowers $257.94 –** Ordered artificial flowers from both Afloral and Amazon. Mix of daffodils (my favorite!), roses, hydrangea, and calla lilies. I put my own bouquet and bridesmaid bouquets together with the input and advice of a few friends. My office manager at work made the boutonnieres and corsages. 
* **Ceremony Decorations $107.79 –** Ivy and wisteria for the archway, and LED candles all from Amazon.
* **Rentals $318 –** This includes the archway rental and the tablecloths for the dinner. It also includes delivery and pickup from the venue. We used Holland’s RentAll in Raleigh and they were great.
* **Cord of Three Strands $34.99 –** Braided during the unity ceremony of our wedding. Ordered from Amazon. 
* **Ceremony Programs and “Register Book” $531.05 –** To go with the theater theme, we decided to hand out Playbills as our wedding program. We listed the order of the ceremony in two “Acts” and we listed all of the bridal party as “Cast Members.” My husband and I wrote little bios to go with them. We paid $160 to have custom artwork commissioned for the cover. It cost $60 to pay for the use of the trademarked Playbill, and they provide an online template to create your own program. It cost $258.80 at Fedex to print the Playbills and have a poster of the artwork made. It cost $52.28 to buy a frame from Michael’s, matted to 16x20. We had people sign well wishes on the frame mat instead of a register book, and now have it hanging in our home as a keepsake. 

***Extras***

* **Hair and Makeup $0 –** I did my own makeup for the day, and my friend did my hair. I don’t wear a ton of makeup normally, so I didn’t want to crazy with a professional makeup artist. My friend and I practiced different simple hairstyles and braids in the days leading up to the wedding. While I did have to buy a few small makeup related things, it wasn’t a huge expense and I didn’t keep close track.
* **Cake $257.01 –** Ordered from Once in a Blue Moon Bakery in Cary, NC. Top tier carrot cake, bottom tier yellow with chocolate and hazelnut fillings. It was large enough to feed \~50 people, and we had a lot left over. It was SO GOOD!
* **Invitations $63.86 -** To also match the theater theme, I custom designed our invitations to look like tickets to a show. I did this through a site called UPrinting. My husband and I went the extra step, bought a perforation tool, and perforated the tickets as well so that the RSVP section acted like a ticket stub you could rip off. Bought black envelopes and gold pens to jazz them up, and I addressed them all by hand.
* **Save The Dates $58.43-** My husband and I went out one afternoon and took a few nice selfies as “engagement pictures.” We used one of those to create a 3”x5” Save The Date magnet that we mailed out to folks. 
* **Wedding Night Hotel $275.20 –** Night before and night of. 
* **Reception Decorations \~$100 –** Lost track of this a little bit. Votive candles and wine glasses from Dollar Tree. Floating LEDs and flower petals from Amazon. Vases and other various items from Goodwill. I’m guessing they added up to about $100.
* **Lots of extras off the top of my head that I didn’t keep track of:** additional makeup items I needed, some crafting extras (ribbon, pins, etc.), 3M hook to hang the braid, shoe inserts, etc. Maybe a couple hundred dollars between all of that? 

I hope this all was helpful! The day turned out wonderfully, and almost everything went according to plan. I’m sure I’ve left some things out, and I’m happy to answer any questions. Best of luck to all my fellow Wedditors currently planning! ",<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x000001BA34BD6150>,self.Weddingsunder10k,wedding checklist

A little background: 
We booked the petite package (20 people included + an optional 20 more people) and we’re coming from the USA

Some questions (some Auchen specific, but others are more general) 

- would you share your wedding planning checklist? Things like when to book external vendors, and when to apply for visas and such. 

- is the owl meet and greet worth it?

- any questions you made sure to ask the coordinator/planner

- Any vendors or food you absolutely loved?

- Any requests that helped your day feel more special/flow smoother 

- we’re not big on dancing so thinking of an alternative for that

Time is also a factor, I don't want to worry that people are spending so much time and effort making food or bitching at me because I don't have the time to contribute! This list will be easy prep and cook, mostly a set it and forget it. You know I'm right. I want you relaxed and having fun for once! If you plan too much and too complicated of food, you will be your normal, overworked (by choice), not fun to be around self. I say we cook the chicken (for curry and skewers) and freeze them and start the sauces on Wed, Shop for the rest and bake the cake on Thurs., Take it all to the cabin and set up and assemble on Fri before and/or after the rehearsal so Saturday can be fun and easy and not stressful or anxiety causing for me and if you are stressing about food we haven't prepared or isn't ready or whatever, I will be too.  Sat morning, I want to relax, hang out with you girls, maybe do some last minute decorations and setting stuff out, get dressed, do our hair and make up, and not freak out.  I am seriously considering finding some valium. I really am SO very nervous!!!! I get shaky and lightheaded whenever I envision me walking down the isle and all those people are there. I can't hardly sleep, all I dream about is all those people and me in some crazy fancy dress doing something stupid. You know that feeling when you get pulled over, that feeling is every time I think about the wedding. Heart palpitating fear. Please don't make it harder on me by overdoing things. 
Thank You! For all your help and work, I do appreciate it!
